To my mother, Zulma Cardona: without you, this dream 
            would never have become a reality.

Worldwide need for alternatives to fossil fuels has driven significant research effort toward the development and scale-up of sustainable forms of energy. Second generation biofuels, obtained from the breakdown of lignocellulosic biomass (e.g., agricultural residues), present a promising alternative. In biofuel production, the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose is currently one of the most costly steps in the biochemical breakdown of lignocellulosic biomass. Economic considerations for large-scale implementation of the enzymatic hydrolysis process demand operation at high solids loadings of biomass (>15\% (w/w)) due to potential for higher product concentrations and reduction of water usage throughout the biorefining process. In the high-solids regime, however, biomass slurries form a high viscosity, non-Newtonian slurry that introduces processing challenges, especially during the initial stages of hydrolysis, due to the low availability of water in the bulk phase. Furthermore, a concomitant reduction in glucose yields with increase in solids loadings has been observed, a phenomenon that is not well understood, but if overcome could hold the key to achieving desirable yields during hydrolysis. During the initial stages of hydrolysis, fast changes in the rheological properties of biomass slurries occur, a process referred to as liquefaction.  In the high-solids regime, fast liquefaction can allow for easier handling (pumping and mixing) of biomass slurries, potentially overcoming some of the mass transport limitations that arise. 
In order to better understand liquefaction, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rheometer was used to perform in-line, \textit{in situ}, real-time, and noninvasive studies on biomass slurries undergoing enzymatic hydrolysis. Batch experiments were done on a steam pretreated lignocellulosic substrate and a model cellulosic substrate with both purified and mixtures of enzymes, under various reaction conditions. The rate and extent of liquefaction was found to be decoupled from the rate and extent of saccharification. During hydrolysis, plug flow was characteristic of all biomass slurries, with lignocellulosic slurries showing a transitional, biphasic plug flow during liquefaction. In addition, end product inhibition was found to have an impact on both saccharification and liquefaction during the initial stage of hydrolysis, which has an impact on scale-up of continuous or semi-continuous hydrolysis processes. Lastly, to address and overcome high-solids limitations, a fed-batch liquefaction process based on using real-time slurry yield stress as a process control variable was designed and tested with a delignified cellulosic substrate. The timing of enzyme addition relative to biomass addition influenced process efficiency, and the upper limit of solids loading was ultimately limited by end product inhibition. The impact of these findings on process kinetic modeling and scale-up are also discussed. 


First and foremost, I would like to thank my co-advisors Professors Michael McCarthy and  Robert Powell, for all their support and mentorship throughout the years. They allowed me to be independent in my research endeavors, and always provided me with the right amount of guidance to overcome the hurdles involved in a Ph.D.. Thank you for supporting me financially and academically throughout my Ph.D., and for the many opportunities to grow professionally. Second, I would like to thank Professor Tina Jeoh, who not only served on my committee, but also ``adopted'' me into her group and thus was another advisor to me over the years. By being in your group I gained an invaluable broader view of biomass conversion research that truly enriched my graduate experience, and had opportunities to grow and learn as a scientist and professional I would not have had otherwise. Thank you for all the support, mentorship, and advice over the years, both academic and otherwise. I absolutely loved how interdisciplinary my research projects were, and that would not have been possible without the expert guidance of Bob, Mike, and Tina, each of whom brought in a different perspective into my different projects, broadening my perspective as a scientist. Again, thank you for your guidance over the years. 

I would like to thank past and present McCarthy lab members, Dr. Lu Zhang, Dr. Mecit {\"O}ztop, Dr. David Lavenson, and Dr. Victor Lim, who have all taught me so much over the years, especially when it comes to NMR, MRI, and MATLAB. I am also incredibly grateful to Dr. Emilio Tozzi, who taught me everything I needed to know about the flow loop (and then some), and with whom I had many great discussions about research over the years. Through your mentorship and help I feel I have become a more well-rounded engineer, and for that I thank you.  

In that same vein, I would also like to thank all Jeoh lab members past and present: Nardrapee Karuna (thank you for help with countless HPLC samples!), Akshata Mudinoor, Scott Strobel, Dutch Boonpermpol, Cassy Gardner, Christopher Roberts, Jennifer Nill, and Patrick O'Dell. I learned so much from and with all of you over the years, be it biochemistry, singing and dancing, or how to start a company. Thanks for some of the best memories from graduate school. 

Outside of the lab, I had incredible support from friends and family over the years. To all my friends and colleagues in both the Chemical Engineering and Materials Science department and the Biological and Agricultural Engineering department, thanks for all the stimulating discussions and great memories. To all my friends I affectionately refer to as ``The Peanut Gallery,'' and others: thanks for all the laughs, the trips, the good memories, and for always being there for me when I needed it, and thank you for keeping me sane all these years. Thanks to my family for supporting me, cheering me on, and always believing in me. I am also deeply thankful to Audrey and Michael Rant for all their relentless support while I was in high school, and beyond. 

I would like to thank my fianc{\'e} Brandon Dutra who has been my rock and best friend through this last stretch of my Ph.D.. Thank you for being there for me when things became tough, and for believing in me when I could not believe in myself. Most importantly, thanks for keeping me grounded on what is important. I love you, and I cannot wait for a lifetime of adventures with you.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my mother, Zulma Cardona, who raised me as a single mom, and who over the years has amazed me with the amount of sacrifice, hard work, and selflessness she has put out to provide a better future for both us. When she was 53 years old (and I was 14), she uprooted her whole life in Paraguay so we could pursue the (sometimes elusive) American Dream. Every single one of my accomplishments are as much hers as they are mine. Thank you for instilling in me the importance of education, and that hard work and dedication trump everything else. I could not have made it this far without your relentless support and sacrifice. You are my hero, and I love you. Thank you for everything.

They say a doctorate can be a solo journey, but I completely disagree. I would never have made it this far without the help of all these individuals, and many more I did not mention but had the fortune to cross paths with over the years. I wish them all the best in their current and future endeavors. Thank you.

Dr. Pernille Skovgaard -- in the brief time we worked together we got some really great work done that kickstarted the second half of my Ph.D. Thank you. 

Sanna Haavisto, Juha Salmella, Jordan Mackenzie -- in the brief time we worked together I learned a lot of rheology from these folks. In both these cases, I would also like to thank Professors Mike McCarthy and Bob Powell for fostering these international collaborations.

Liz Anthony and Alice Tang, my roommates at different points in graduate school. Thanks for being great roommates and friends, and for the support over the years.

Background and Outline

Overview
Increasing population size and exponential technological advances have driven up the demand for energy, which in the coming decades needs to come from sustainable and renewable sources to address concerns over global climate change and limited resources. In the United States, as much as 28\% of the total energy usage comes from transportation energy, of which as much as 92\% is mainly derived from fossil fuels \citep{davis2014}. Fossil fuels are thought to be the cause of significant greenhouse gas emissions, a cause of global warming \citep{schneider2000,pimentel2002}. In the United States, in order to offset the need for fossil fuels, the congressional Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) established the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The RFS program states that 30\% of the ethanol output, or as much as 36 billion gallons, must come from renewable sources by 2022 \citep{schnepf2010}. Biofuels derived from plant sugars (first-generation biofuels, e.g., corn ethanol) are widely commercialized; up to 1.7 billion gallons are currently produced per year in the U.S. \citep{epa2015}. However, increasing first-generation biofuel production alone would not be able to meet EPA mandates without competing with the food supply needed for a growing population and significant increase in land usage \citep{pimentel2002}, which can lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the creation of additional food croplands needed to account for land diverted to biofuel production \citep{searchinger2008}. Second-generation biofuels, i.e., cellulosic biofuels, have a significant potential for meeting EPA RFS mandates. Cellulosic biofuels are derived from the breakdown of the lignocellulose present in plants, which are currently abundantly present in agricultural residues. Conversion of plant waste to usable fuel is, however, expensive and difficult due to the recalcitrance of plants to breakdown \citep{himmel2007}.  In the past few decades, significant research efforts have gone into the scale-up of cellulosic biofuel processes by investigating ways to make every step of the process more economically viable and efficient. In the United States, the first commercial cellulosic biofuel plants have begun operating in 2014 \citep{rfa2015}, but their expected yield would still be short of the expected RFS yields. For example, by 2016, the RFS estimates a cellulosic biofuel output of 206 million gallons, or almost double the 2015 output (107 million gallons) \citep{epa2015}.

Currently, cellulosic ethanol is 70\% more expensive to produce than corn ethanol (as of November 2014, costs were \$4/gal versus \$2.37/gal, respectively

Cellulosic biomass can be converted in a variety of ways, including a thermochemical pathway and a biochemical pathway (enzymatic hydrolysis) \citep{sims2010}. Going from agricultural waste to cellulosic ethanol through a biochemical pathway consists of a series of steps (post-harvesting) that include \citep{wyman1999},


 Particle size reduction: reduction of the feedstock's average particle size, usually by mechanical means (e.g., milling);
 Pretreatment: physical or chemical treatment (e.g., with steam, dilute acid, ionic liquid) of the lignocellulosic biomass to remove lignin or hemicellulosic components, reduce recalcitrance, and make the cellulose more accessible to cellulases;
 Enzymatic hydrolysis: enzyme-catalyzed breakdown of the cellulose to its component glucose monomers by cleavage of the $\beta$-(1,4) glycosidic bonds between glucose units;
 Fermentation: glucose conversion to ethanol by microorganisms (e.g., yeast, \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}); and
\item Separation of products: the necessary separation, filtration, and distillation steps to extract ethanol or other by-products.
\end{enumerate}

The variety of ways to perform each step, as well as the unlisted but necessary separation steps between each major process (e.g., washing post-pretreatment and pre-hydrolysis), can make the cost of this process high, and highly variable. In this pathway to cellulosic ethanol production, the depolymerization of cellulose to glucose by enzymatic hydrolysis (step 3) is currently one of the most expensive steps, up to 25\% of the cost per gallon of bioethanol produced \citep{humbird2011}, and it therefore is the focus of the studies in this dissertation. In general, there are two major approaches to improve the process economics of this step: (1) with an in-depth understanding and model development of the hydrolysis kinetics to drive reactor design under optimal conditions, and (2) with process modifications to understand, from a practical standpoint, how different variables may affect the extent of hydrolysis and process efficiency. Detailed background on each is provided below, and is the motivation behind this work.

Enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass is a highly heterogeneous chemical reaction difficult to model kinetically, which hinders scale-up and reactor design efforts. Cellulosic biomass consists of approximately 75\% carbohydrate polymers. Cellulose, a $\beta$-1,4-linked chain of glucose monomers, can make up 15-30\% of the primary and 40\% of the secondary cell wall \citep{meng2014}. Despite this abundance, cellulosic biomass is extremely recalcitrant to breakdown due to the close association between cellulose and hemicellulose (a polysaccharide of various hexoses and pentoses) and lignin (a complex polymer of phenyl propane units) within the plant cell wall \citep{mosier2005,jorgensen2007}. Yields of <20\% can be achieved with biomass in its native form \citep{mosier2005}. To improve the accessibility of enzymes to cellulose, biomass conversion processes generally include some form of particle size reduction and pretreatment, both of which help dissociate cellulose from hemicellulose and lignin \citep{wyman1999}. Pretreatment in particular can disrupt the plant cell wall by breaking hydrogen bonds between components and improving accessibility \citep{mosier2005,meng2014,hu2012}. In addition, isolation of cellulose by pretreament can reduce hydrolysis inefficiencies that come from unproductive adsorption of cellulases to lignin \citep{jorgensen2007,gregg1996,ohgren2007}.
The plant cell wall is comprised mainly of cellulose (a glucose polysaccharide), hemicellulose , and lignin (a polymer (?)) \citep{•}, and the interaction of hemicellulose and lignin with cellulose further complicates hydrolysis of cellulose due to limiting enzyme accessibility. 
Cellulases are expressed by a wide variety of microbial and fungal microorganisms; most commercial mixtures currently available contain cellulases from \textit{Trichoderma reesei}, a fungus available XXX [CITE] due to its productivity in thermostability in hydrolyzing cellulose [CITE]

Cellulases are enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of cellulose to glucose, cellobiose, or other oligosaccharides through cleavage of the $\beta$-(1,4) glycosidic bonds in cellulose \citep{jorgensen2007}. Cellulases vary in their form of action. The main enzymes that depolymerize cellulose are: cellobiohydrolases, which are processive enzymes that bind at a reducing or non-reducing end of a cellulose chain and cleave cellobiose (glucose dimers) from cellulose upon hydrolysis, endoglucanases, which randomly cleave cellulose chains resulting in shorter-chain polysaccharides, and $\beta$-glucosidases, which act exclusively on the soluble fraction of the hydrolyzate, cleaving cellobiose into two glucose monomers \citep{jorgensen2007,lee1980}. Commercial cellulase mixtures, in general, include a mixture of all these cellulases, as well as other enzymes like endoxylanases (hemicellulases) to help with non-cellulosic portions of the biomass slurry. During hydrolysis, two main physicochemical changes occur: saccharification (end product release) and liquefaction (viscosity changes in the bulk due to fiber attrition and water release from the cellulosic fibers). Liquefaction is mainly attributed to endoglucanase action \citep{szijarto2011,skovgaard2014}, while other cellulases (cellobiohydrolases and $\beta$-glucosidases) mainly contribute to saccharification due to their specific activity in releasing glucose and cellobiose products \citep{lee1980}. All of these are needed to successfully hydrolyze biomass efficiently, and significant research has gone into understanding the synergy between these enzymes and their kinetics. 

In the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to sugars via the enzymatic pathway, the crux of the problem lies on the hydrolysis kinetics. A good kinetic model is crucial if scale-up is to occur readily because it would simplify reactor modeling at different production scales, and an in-depth understanding results in versatility in process design. However, we still do not have a satisfactory model [CITE]. 

Early approaches to kinetic modeling treated hydrolysis of cellulose as a Michaelis-Menten system [CITE], but that is hardly accurate because it is a heterogneous system and XXXX	[REASONS FOR BAD FIT OF MM].

Despite this understanding of how different cellulases hydrolyze cellulose, modeling the kinetics of this heterogeneous reaction is challenging. First, lignocellulosic biomass can come from a multitude of sources, which results in different degrees of complexity and composition. Second, the enzymes' performance will vary depending on the microorganism that is expressing them and the reaction conditions. The hydrolysis of cellulose is catalyzed by cellulases, but the system is highly heterogeneous because reaction occurs at the solid-liquid interface where traditional enzyme kinetics models, like Michaelis-Menten or adsorption models, do not necessarily apply \citep{bansal2009}.  Only the hydrolysis of cellobiose to glucose by $\beta$-glucosidase is truly occurring in the liquid (soluble) phase. Cellulose, however, is insoluble, and its morphology can further complicate hydrolysis kinetics. Cellulose polymers aggregate into microfibrils and larger fibrils \citep{jeoh2013}, which are porous \citep{wong1988}, and have different degrees of crystallinity \citep{hall2010,park2010}. All these features make the system highly complex and challenging to model.

Kinetic modeling of this heterogeneous reaction is important for developing a fundamental understanding of the relevant and rate-limiting variables, but it often becomes a challenge to include all the relevant variables (e.g., adsorption, substrate features and properties) without overparametrizing in a computationally prohibitive way. A recent review by \citet{bansal2009} highlights the main classes of models up until that point --- empirical models, Michaelis-Menten models, and adsorption models --- and their shortcomings. Empirical models can show which system variables affect hydrolysis rates but, in general, are limited by the fact that they apply to the system they are developed on, and not necessarily globally. This is a great shortcoming in the case of cellulose hydrolysis, as substrates and enzymes vary greatly in nature. Michaelis-Menten kinetics require a homogeneous system and the quasi-steady state approximation is not met. Adsorption models account for the adsorption step onto a heterogeneous substrate via Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics (Langmuir isotherm), which assumes reversible adsorption with non-interacting species, with a homogeneous mixture and binding sites. However, most of these assumptions do not apply to cellulase kinetics. In general, these models were not satisfactory, as assumptions used were not valid, and models were not validated over the whole course of hydrolysis \citep{bansal2009}.  
%and stochastic and mathematical models that. although good for deriving kinetics form a very fundamental standpoint, end up being too complex for scale-up applications.
%kinetic modeling approaches have taken a more ``bottom-up'' approach by either creating complex substrate models of cellulose fibrils and investigating how enzymes hydrolyze it, or by modeling the mechanistic enzyme reaction steps over the course of hydrolysis. They are good for developing a fundamental understading of how the biomass breaks down, but because there was limited empirical data available as to what biomass looks like as it is broken down [CITE], models that derive fundamental kinetics based on known modes of enzymatic action are only fit and applicable for early hydrolysis. , unless long-term empirical observations are known that can be somehow incorporated into this. Despite this shortcoming, substra-centric models, which often try to account for diffsuvity of enzymes, may be suitable in the short-term just fine, since that is when mass transfer limitations are the biggest concern. Once the substrate is more liquified, maybe a different model, something more Michaelis-Menten with adsorption and inhibition included may be ussificient [CITE ONE OF THE PAPERS I RECENTLY GAVE OFF TO NARA?].
Since the review by \citet{bansal2009}, kinetic modeling of hydrolysis has become increasingly more complex to account for all the different variables and their interaction during heterogeneous hydrolysis. Rather than deriving models empirically, some of the more successful modeling attempts since the review by \citet{bansal2009} have derived models from a fundamental standpoint, sometimes mechanistically, and have then tested those models on real systems. In general, current kinetic models start from either rate equations that represent the individual enzymatic steps of cellulase enzymes (in particular cellobiohydrolase I, e.g., Cel7A), or a model system that represents a cellulose substrate (with its corresponding surface roughness, crystallinity, et cetera accounted for). Models that begin by accounting for the differences in enzymatic mode of action of different cellulases are mechanistic in nature and attempt to capture most (if not all) of the following steps: (i) diffusion of enzymes to the cellulose substrate, (ii) diffusion along the surface to an accessible reducing end, (iii) adsorption of the carbohydrate binding module and catalytic domain onto the cellulose surface, (iv) threading of the cellulose chain into the catalytic domain, (v) complexation of the catalytic domain with glucosyl units on the cellulose, (vi) cleavage of the bonds, (vii) procession of the enzyme along the chain, or desorption, and can often account for productive and unproductive binding \citep{jalak2010,gao2013,beckham2014,tsai2014,cruys2013}. Mechanistic enzyme-driven models are an improvement over past kinetic models, as they capture the complexity involved in each hydrolysis event, and can highlight which step (e.g., adsorption, complexation, desorption) is rate-limiting in a process. However, these models generally apply only to purified enzymes, and may not necessarily capture the true nature of synergism, or how a commercial enzyme mixture would perform. The other subset of kinetic models in recent years involve the development of a model of the cellulose substrate in order to capture morphological changes during hydrolysis. Cellulose has been modeled as, for example, a porous cylinder \citep{luterbacher2013}, a series of particles with various gap sizes and extents of accessibility \citep{zhou2009a}, and populations of chains that get depolymerized during hydrolysis \citep{griggs2012}. Models like these, which are substrate-centric, succeed in capturing how the substrate may be changing due to fiber attrition, but can often be computationally demanding and require assumptions that fail to model a real substrate. For instance, some models have to assume that changes occur along only one dimension of the substrate to reduce the number of computations required, e.g., by assuming infinitely long cylinders \citep{luterbacher2013,zhou2009a} where only the inside (radial direction) is changing. Due to this assumption, these models tend to best fit short-term hydrolysis (first few hours of hydrolysis). More recently, \citet{eibinger2014} tried developing a more fundamental understanding of how the morphology changes during hydrolysis by generating an extremely smooth cellulose surface and observing the changes on it during hydrolysis with Atomic Force Microscopy, and from there trying to derive predictive models of enzyme behavior. Empirical studies such as these could be used to validate and improve substrate-centric kinetic models such that substrate changes over the entire course of hydrolysis can be modeled. Ultimately, a global kinetic model for hydrolysis will likely not be strictly enzyme- or substrate-driven, but would encompass mechanistic changes in both to accurately model hydrolysis at all time scales and with a variety of substrates, enzymes, and processing conditions. For instance, a successful kinetic model might be an adaptive model that captures the essential variables during early hydrolysis (e.g., substrate crystallinity and accessibility), and captures others at later times (e.g., end-product inhibition, enzyme inactivation, irreversible adsorption). 

In other words, during the growth portion of the hydrolysis saturation curve, it might model the substrate and enzymes in a mechanistic way may, and in the plateau/linear growth region hydrolysis saturation curve may be better fit by a simpler, homogeneous kinetic model that accounts for the issues that arise in the long term, like when enzymes are irreversibly adsorbed, end-product inhibited, and when only the most stubbotrn of cellulose is left to be broken down.

Maybe it's too much to ask that a kinetic model fit hydrolysis at all times, and instead what is needed is a model 


Models and work like this is essential for developing better kientic models that account for both enzymatic activity and structural changes to cellulose during hydrolysis. More recently, \citet{eibinger2014} tried developing a more fundamental understanding of how the morphology changes during hydrolysis by generating an extremely smooth cellulose surface and observing the changes during hydrolysis with Atomic Force Microscopy, and from there trying to derive predictive models of enzyme behavior. Models and work like this is essential for developing better kientic models that account for both enzymatic activity and structural changes to cellulose during hydrolysis. Substrate-centric models are great in trying to incorporate what is actually happening to the cellulose and how its morphology affects hydrolysis. Prior kinetic models use systems too dilute to be useful in scale-up, especially at high solids loadings. Currently, however, substrate-cntric models are rather computationally complex [CITE SPECIFICS], and require siginificant simplification to be useful. Empirical testing of these models is thus necessary to determine which variables are relevant and which can be dropped to simplify computational demand. 

Substrate-centric models are thus trying to capture how the morphology of the substrtae is changing during hydrolysis as the enzymes ``erode'' the surface. \citet{zhou2009a} claim they are one of the first to try to capture chnages in morphology duyring hydrolysis via their model of SACs (surface-accessible cellulose). 

Enzyme-centric models, which model enzyme kinetics by better understanding each of the kinetic steps of cellulase enzymes, generally start or focus on Cel7A, a reducing-end acting cellobiohydrolase I. It is probably the most studied of enzymes, as it does the bulk of the work [PHRASING] by removing cellobiose from cellulose.  For isntance, enzymes may irreversibly adsorb nonproductively [CITE], or bind in a non-productive way [CITE]. Enzyme-centric models then focus on modeling each of these productive and non-prodtive steps, and deriving the rate constants associated with them to see which step is the limitng step and how to improve it. [Different k's for enzymes...]. Enzyme-centric models are a good start, but more work is needed to better understand what exactly constitutes productive binding (since current measurements of adsorbed enzymes make a lot of asusmptions about the behavior of enzymes and where they are present), and the ``[S]'' (substrate concentration) involved in complexation of enzyme with the substrtae is still poorly understood and hard to measure experimentally.

High-solids hydrolysis of biomass
Main issues and current ways to address them
The enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass is one of the most expensive steps in the biochemical pathway to cellulosic biofuels \citep{humbird2011}. Other than developing a fundamental understanding of the kinetics of the process, attempts at enabling scale-up have also looked at modifying the process to be more efficient and economically viable. Generally, the goal of any scaled-up process is to achieve high yields while lowering processing and capital costs. One way by which to reduce costs in biomass conversion is to perform the enzymatic hydrolysis step at high concentrations (>15\% (w/w)) of biomass, i.e., high solids loadings \citep{jorgensen2007,modenbach2013}. With high solids loadings, the concentrations of products increase and less water is needed overall, which can account for up to 30\% of costs in a low solids process \citep{galbe2002}. At >15\% (w/w) loadings, the ethanol yield after fermentation is >4\% (w/w), which is considered desirable for this process \citep{szijarto2011}. At these loadings, however, the system has limited bulk-phase water available, which hinders mixing, pumping, and incurs mass transfer limitations. Viscosities increase significantly with increasing loadings, resulting in a non-Newtonian slurry that is challenging to handle \citep{knutsen2009,fan2007}. This can also limit enzyme kinetics due to poor mass transfer (poor diffusion and adsorption of both enzymes and products) \citep{hodge2008,kristensen2009}. In fact, a concomitant reduction in cellulose conversion with increase in solids loadings has been noted and is often referred to as the ``solids effects'' \citep{kristensen2009,hodge2008}. 

A more fundamental approach to high-solids hydrolysis is by developing a better understanding of the ``solids effects,'' and determining which factors contribute the most to the reduction in conversion. \citet{kristensen2009} worked on isolating variables (e.g., end product concentration, water content, composition) to see how each affects high-solids conversion. Their results indicated that a reduction in adsorption can be correlated with limited conversion, and that each of the isolated variables alone do not entirely contribute to the solids effect. In contrast, \citet{hodge2008} performed studies on pretreated corn stover at various solids contents and found that soluble sugars (i.e., end products) contributed the most to the solids effects. high-solids hydrolysis by understanding the solids effects well is challenging, as variables can be confounding, and the importance of different variables may vary with the substrate and enzyme used. 

It is, however, difficult to isolate variabnles, since different aspects are closely entangled. For isntance, isolating the effect of water content by replacing it with a different chemical that is actually a surfactant, like they did, may remove tyhe water variable, but surfactants may be reducing the overall friction between fibrils, reducing the crowding behavior, and mitigating the impact that the removal of water had.
 
or engineering the componentns (i.e., enzymes and substrates) to improve the extent and efficiency of hydrolysis. Research has looked at enzyme mixture optimization [CITE], new genetically modified enzymes[CITE], and changing reaction conditions [WORDING, CITE]. but this requires in-depth understanding of a process, which is still a work in progress for biomass conversion

In order to enable high-solids hydrolysis of biomass experimentally, researchers have looked at different ways to process and handle such high concentrations of biomass. One approach is through design of customized equipment set up for mixing solids \citep{roche2009b,di2011,larsen2012}, since traditional impeller mixers for liquid mixtures are unlikely to mix contents throughout the reactor homogeneously, forming cavities (\citet{pakzad2008} modeled these cavities with computational fluid dynamics of a fluid with similar behavior as biomass suspensions). Another approach is through process design, using primarily fed-batch or semi-batch processes in which biomass is added in stages so as to not be exceedingly hard to pump and mix at the beginning, but still attaining high solids loadings by the end of hydrolysis. Using a variety of substrates including pretreated corn stover \citep{chandra2011,hodge2009}, sugarcane bagasse \citep{gao2014}, and paper \citep{elliston2013}, experiments adding biomass in batches have been able to reach solids as high as 65\% (w/v) \citep{elliston2013}, which would have otherwise been difficult to attain in batch mode. One common issue with fed-batch hydrolysis is the need for optimization of batch addition times and amounts, which some have optimized with off-line experiments \citep{gao2014}. At higher solids and higher concentrations of products, however, end-product inhibition of cellulases becomes a significant issue \citep{kristensen2009}. Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) and similar processes provide a solution for high concentrations of end products \citep{cannella2014}. In a SSF process, after a certain period of hydrolysis, microorganisms are added to ferment glucose and convert it to ethanol, which is less inhibitory for cellulases \citep{olofsson2008}, but can inhibit microorganisms during fermentation. A challenge in SSF processes is that conditions need to be optimized for both microorganisms and enzymes, which may be optimal at significantly different temperatures (e.g., microorganisms perform best at 30 \degree{C} and typical cellulase mixtures perform best at around 45-50 \degree{C}) \citep{sun2002,philippidis1996}. Achieving high-solids hydrolysis by modification of the process, with fed-batch/semi-batch processes or SSF-type processes is a viable solution, but would require significant pilot-scale optimization prior to large-scale implementation to optimize for the enzymes, organisms, and substrates used.



Still others have looked at enabling high-solids processing indirectly by redcuing particle size even further [CITE?] to more readily reach high solids, or using more abrasive pretreatment methods like ionic liquids or [THAT SHELL METHOD] that significantly reduce biomass reclacitrance so that enzymatic digestion can happen easily. Doing high-solids hydrolysis this way, however, is expensive, as equipment has to be custom-built, new pretreatment techniques have to be designed (and those products of prtreatments need to be removed downstream expensively), and enzyme genetic engineering requires significant work and trial and error to do so [CITE SOMETHING ON EACH OF THESE THINGS].

Another means by which to perform high-solids hydrolysis is by modifying the process itself, for instance by using different processing schemes. Fed-batch and semi-batch hydrolysis has been used for years to reach higher solids loadings by adding biomass in batches, reducing the initial impact of adding all solids at the start of hydrolysis.

\section{Rheology of biomass suspensions}
Measuring rheological changes during hydrolysis of biomass, specifically liquefaction, can be quite challenging due to the complexity of biomass. Lignocellulosic biomass is comprised of cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose, and are fibrous in nature. Their fibrous structure makes them rheologically complex, as fibers interact, can tangle, and crowd when in suspension \citep{kerekes1985}. Their interaction can be quantified by a crowding number which can be telling of the fibers' propensity to flocculate in suspension \citep{kerekes1992}. Crowding number has been correlated with concentration of fibers \citep{kerekes1992} and yield stress \citep{kerekes1995,tozzi2014}, and can therefore be another measure of suspension rheology, especially during hydrolysis, as it captures fiber interaction better than concentration alone. This crowding behavior likely contributes to the ``solids effects,'' with microfibrils associating and becoming entangled in a way that hinders mass transport of components in the continuous phase of the suspension. In addition, cellulosic suspensions exhibit non-Newtonian, shear-thinning behavior and have a yield stress \citep{stickel2009,knutsen2009,lavenson2011,pimenova2004}. These features make it difficult to scale up processes due to handling challenges.
"At higher concentrations of cellulose, microfibrils may also be associating, getting entangled in a way that contributes to this ``solids effect'' -- the decrease in degree of conversion at a constant cellulase to cellulose ratio when concentraiton of cellulose increases" \citep{jalak2014,modenbach2013,kristensen2009,roberts2011}. This crowding behavior likely contributes to the ``solids effects'' due to the rheological complexity. Biomass, as solids increase, is non-Newtonian, exhibiting a yield stress that is dependent on concentration of fiber [CITE AND CONFIRM DAVID]. , and can be thixotropic, exhibting a time-dependent shear-thinning behavior, under some conditions [CITE]


Extensive work has gone into characterizing biomass rheology due to the process concerns involved with handling a non-Newtonian, concentrated suspension. Rheology of a slurry, and more specifically its yield stress, becomes of increasing importance at high solids loadings; it is the most process-relevant rheological characteristic in fiber suspensions, since it needs to be exceeded for flow to occur \citep{derakhshandeh2011}. \citet{stickel2009} performed an interlaboratory study to characterize pretreated corn stover suspensions with a variety of techniques and found it to appear as a thick paste at 20\% (w/w) insoluble solids, with its elastic modulus far exceeding its viscous modulus. Traditional rheometers are however limited in their ability to characterize biomass suspensions, especially during liquefaction when fast changes in rheology are occurring. For example, parallel plate and cone-and-plate geometries (of traditional rheometers) geometries might squeeze out the water in suspensions, misrepresenting the total amount of solids \citep{knutsen2009}. In the case of cup-and-bob or vane-in-cup geometries, the gap size may be within the order of magnitude of the particle size (e.g., gap could be 1000 $\mu$m, and lignocellulose particles can range in the hundreds of $\mu$m range), which makes the assumptions implicit of the technique not viable. A continuous flow profile, which is assumed with these geometries, is difficult to obtain. In addition to the issues with particle size and squeezing associated with a suspended solid, biomass suspensions are opaque, which limits the scope of optical techniques at high concentrations. Another means by which to characterize biomass rheology is through in-process, less invasive measurements. Hydrolysis processes have been designed in which \textit{ex situ} viscosity measurements can be done \citep{sjoede2013}. Still others have measured rheological properties via measuring torque of an impeller mixer within a reactor to characterize flow profiles \citep{pimenova2004}. All of these studies provide insight into processing challenges, and measurement of properties like torque with a given mixer geometry can hint at equipment sizing. 

In-line rheological measurements are likely the most suitable for biomass characterization regardless of composition and particle size due to their versatility. In dilute suspensions, techniques like Ultrasound Doppler Velocimetry (UDV) are suitable; they measure velocity profiles of particulate suspensions noninvasively, and have been extensively used for, for instance, dilute cellulose fiber suspensions \citep{wiklund2001}, and nanocellulose suspensions that can be thixotropic and gel-like \citep{klemm2011}. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) rheometry works well to characterize more concentrated biomass suspensions. By using the magnetic dipole moments of nuclei in the suspension, it can measure a variety of properties of a mixture, and has been used extensively to characterize cellulosic and lignocellulosic biomass, even when undergoing liquefaction \citep{lavenson2011,tozzi2014,skovgaard2014}. MRI works well regardless of how opaque, turbid, or concentrated a suspension is. Furthermore, because it is fast (images can be acquired in just a few minutes \citep{arola1997}), it provides near real-time characterization of suspensions. For these reasons, it is great for characterizing bioamss rheology under different conditions, especially when undergoing enzymatic hydrolysis, when those changes might be happening at time scales that off-line rheometers might not be able to capture.

Magnetic resonance imaging velocimetry
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are techniques that use the interaction between magnetic moments in the nuclei of a sample and an applied external magnetic field to obtain structural, spatial, and translational molecular data \citep{choi2002}. In order to obtain rheological information with MRI, velocity measurements can be performed in conjunction with in-line pressure drop measurements to get rheograms of a fluid that include both shear rate and shear stress information, as well as yield stress, which is a relevant variable in the case of biomass suspensions. 

In MRI measurements, an NMR spectrometer is coupled with field gradients which allow for spatial characterization of a sample. Gradients allow for a sample to be probed at a range of frequencies and phase shifts, which can be transformed to spatial information in two or three dimensions in the time domain (for example, with a Fourier Transform). In an NMR or MRI experiment, a sample is placed within a magnetic field and a magnetic pulse or pulses are applied via current sent through a radio frequency (RF) coil enclosing the sample, and the response of the sample as it returns (i.e., relaxes) to its initial magnetization is measured \citep{liang2000}. By changing how these pulses are applied (i.e., with different sequences), different properties of a sample can be probed. 
%In a static system, the environment surrounding the nuclei being probed (in the case of the work in this dissertation, protons) can affect how those nuclei relax to their initial magnetization provided by the magnet's field. In the case of MRI, Differences in relaxation in different parts of a sample then result in different levels of contrast depending on the sequence used. For example, if a sequence that highlights T1 (spin-lattice relaxation time, or the time for a proton to relax back to its initial magnetization) contrast is used, parts of the sample that have shorter [?] T1 relaxation times will apear as higher intensity than regions with longer relaxation times [CITE?]. In the case of a biomass system, this might result in high signal intensity for a region where protons in water are highly constrained (e.g., near the solid fraction) and low signal intensity for water in the bulk. This highlights how good MRI can be for telling physcochemical properties of a system, especially when the system is highly heterogenous and opaque like a biomass system. MRI flow imaging then is great for characterizing these properties, especially as they are constantly changing under enzymatic action.
 
The RF coil is generally tuned to the frequency of the nuclei being probed (which have to have a dipole moment, a not full valence electron shell [CITE AND CONFIRM]), which allows th wmagnetization of mainly those nuclei. 

Magnetic resonance flow imaging
To characterize flow, NMR/MRI exploit flow artifacts in static measurements to obtain flow behavior. Flow artifacts appear as spatial movement of the nuclear spins and as phase changes in the transverse component of the magnetization \citep{budinger1988}. In the former, longitudinal magnetization effects (time-of-flight effects) arise, and signal amplitude is used for velocity detection. In the latter, effects on the transverse component of the magnetization show up as phase effects as the spins move along a phase gradient. In this case, both the signal phase and amplitude are used for velocity detection, which has a higher dynamic range than when only affecting the longitudinal magnetization \citep{budinger1988}. Due to its greater resolution, these latter flow artifacts will be targeted in the MRI sequence used throughout this dissertation. A Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) sequence, often used to measure diffusion of nuclei in a sample, can be used to detect these effects with the use of time-dependent field gradients \citep{stejskal1965,mccarthy2012}. A PGSE sequence is, in essence, a spin echo sequence coupled with frequency and phase gradients to obtain two-dimensional spatial resolution of a velocity profile. A frequency-encoded gradient allows for spatial (i.e., radial) localization of signal, and a phase-encoded gradient allows for velocity encoding of the signal; velocities are determined from displacement as a function of time in steady flow \citep{choi2002,altobelli1991}. Signal intensity is dependent on flow rates, relaxation times (e.g., T1 and T2) of the sample, as well as any local inhomogeneities that can arise. In general, in a two-dimensional image, each row (the radial direction) is the digitization of the echo. The magnetization is first dephased and then rephased with a phase gradient pulse. Each column (velocity axis, direction of flow) is a digitization in the phase encoding direction, orthogonal to the frequency encoding direction \citep{arola1997}.  As mentioned, gradients are applied in the form of a range of frequencies and a range of phase shifts; the data is thus in the frequency domain and is transformed with, for instance, a Fourier Transform, into a matrix of signal intensities in the time domain to obtain an image. The signal intensity $S$ is given by \citep{arola1997},
\begin{equation}
S(k,q,T)=\int{\Bigg[\rho(r)\cdot e^{ikr}* \int{P(\Delta z,r;T)\cdot e^{iq\Delta z}d\Delta z}\Bigg]dr}
\label{eq:mri_signal}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the nuclei density (as a function of radial position $r$), $P(\Delta z,r;T)$ is the conditional probability that a spin at $r$ will be displaced by $\Delta z$ during time $T$. Variables $k$ and $q$ are conjugate to $r$ and $\Delta z$, respectively. During a flow experiment, imaging parameters are chosen so as to maximize signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) without sacrificing the size of the region of interest \citep{fukushima1999}. Coupling MRI velocimetry data with in-line pressure drop measurements yields rhoelogical information on the imaged sample. A discrete derivative of the velocity profile as a function of position provides shear rates, $\dot{\gamma} = |\frac{-dv}{dr}|$, and the pressure drop measured in-line can be used to obtain the shear stress at each radial position using $\tau = \Delta P\cdot R/2L$ \citep{choi2002}. MRI rheometry has been extensively used in this manner to characterize the rheology of various suspensions and fluids including pretreated corn stover \citep{lavenson2011}, tomato juice and corn syrup \citep{choi2002}, and suspensions of buoyant particles \citep{altobelli1991}. 

In the case of biomass suspensions that are rheologically complex, yield stresses are often derived from fitting rheograms to models like Bingham plastic and Herschel-Bulkley due to their pseudoplastic, shear-thinning behavior [CITE].

 in accordance to known T1 and T2 of the sample so as to improve SNR. In an acquired image, the dimensions of the image are defined by the field of view (FOV), and the volume imaged is defined by the slice thickness. Increasing (?) either of these will improve SNR; however, too high a FOV will reduce the resolution of the flow region. Additional parameters to keep in mind to obtain highly resolved flow profiles are the repetition time (TR) and velocity sweep width (VSW), the latter of which is closely tied to the echo time (TE). TR refers to the time that spans between each repetition of the Spin Echo sequence; it needs to be optimized so that it is long enough for the spins previously magnetized to relax, but not so long that the volume of interest flows out of the region. In biomass imaging, especially at high solids, TR will generally be short, in the order of 30-100 ms, and much longer (200-300 ms) if the biomass is dilute or the sample is mostly water. VSW and TE are closely tied, and are related to the T2 of the sample. Half the echo time (TE/2, $\tau$) is the time that spans between the 90\degree and 180\degree pulses, and between the 180\degree pulse and the acquisition, and it is best if it is short (10-20 ms [CITE]) for samples with short relaxation times to avoid losing signal. VSW is related to the velocity range covered by the phase encode gradient. If TE is short, VSW is large, and this works well for samples that are flowing fast or have relaxation times too short. For better velocity reoslution, VSW should be just slightly higher than the maximum velocity of a fluid so that the velocity profile takes up most of the imaged volume. This often results in a trade-off for samples that have short relaxation times; in order to best match the VSW to the maximum velocity, TE needs to be made longer, which results in a lower SNR in the resulting image. Concenrs like thse are always present when imaging a moving fluid.

$T_1$ (the spin-lattice relaxation time) and $T_2$ (the spin-spin relaxation time) are inherent of the sample, $\rho$ is the nuclei density (in this case, \ce{1H} density), $K$ is a constant, and TE and TR are experimental parameters the define how the spin-echo sequence is run, and can affect the image in ways detailed below.

%During an imaging experiment, these feature can be used to generate contrast between flowing and static regions. If, for example, two consecutive pulses are applied (e.g., a 90 \degree followed by a 180 \degree pulse, for a Spin Echo experiment), the fact that the pulses are not instantaneous will result in different signal intensities in the flowing and static parts of a sample. If the sample is flowing, it would not be in the same spatial location by the time the second pulse is applied. Thus, the flowing region retains the magnetization warranted by the first pulse, and the second pulse saturates the signal of the static region, making it lose signal intesnsity. This allows for high contrast of the flowing region. The amplitude of the signal is used as an indicator of flow velocity [CITE]. In one image, the sequence is repeated the number pf phase encode steps decided. In a lot of the work in thios dissertation, images are 128 x 128 in resolution. This means that the sequence is run 128 times, each time with a step increase in the phase gradient strength (stepwise increase in strength), and each time, the full frequency gradient is run so as to encode position correpsonding with each phase gradient strength. After 128 repetitions, the flow profile is fully acquired. To improve signal intensity, the number of averages can be increased, so that each step is performed additional times to improve th signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Mass Transfer
Scale-up of high solids hydrolysis (for economic reasons) requires a deep udnerstanding of the kinetics. Significant work has gone into understanding the kinetics of hydrolsis from an empirical and a mechanistic standpoint (see Introduction -- Kinetics). This is tackled at low loadings of both enzymes and biomass, so as to not run into saturation issues. At high solids however, a host of new issues are introduced \citep{hodge2008,kristensen2009}. In hihg solids hydrolysis of biomass, one of the inhibitors under the umbrella of ``high solids effects'' are mass transfer effects. In fact, most issues can be attributed to this. At high solids loadings of biomass ($>$ 15 \% (w/w)), water is not as readily available in the bulk, the suspension is non-Newtonian, and therefore really difficult to pump and mix \citep{lavenson2011,roche2009}. Because you can't mix, maintaining homogeneity in the reactor is limited to diffusive processes, and these are also limited when most of the suspension is a solid [CITE]. Diffusion and adsoprtion are crucial steps in the hydrolysis kinetics of this heterogeneous system [CITE]. First of all, cellulases need to diffuse to reaction sites, to the accesible surface areas so they can cleave glycosidic bonds. From there, they adsorb onto the substrate, or diffuse along the surface. Once cleavage happens, those products (e.g., glucose, cellobiose) need to diffuse away from the susbtrate so as to not sterically hinder the cellulases from further hydrolysis [CITE SOURCE FOR ALL THESE STEPS]. If any of these mass transfer processes become limited, a bottleneck results. This is particularly important during early hydrolysis at high solids before liquefaction takes place, which can improve the mixability of the suspension [CITE]. Hydrolysis is at its fastest at the beginning; limiting that could results in long-term slowdown [CITE]. Some models exist that try to quantify this mass transfer, but so far it has not been successfully measured. Kinetic models don't seem to work very well at high solids due to all the confounding effects happening. Therefore the goal of this work was to directly measure some of these mass transfer steps to help validate models at high solids and get closer to creating a kientic model that works not only at low loadings, but also at high loadings that incorporates mass transfer limitations. Understanding mass transfer limitations might also be the key to overcoming them.

%The goal of this work was to measure diffusivities and adsorption of cellulases in cellulosic fiber beds at different solids loadgins and enzyme concentrations to effectively characterize mass transfer of cellulases, which in the past has only been done at low loadings [CITE, AND UPDATE].
%
%A lot of kinetic models include diffusivity to characterize kinetics \citep{luterbacher2013} [CITE OTHERS]. While this work may only characterize effective diffusivities due to the confounding variables involed in measuring diffusivity in porous fibers , it may shed light on some of the mass transfer problems that arise during early hydrolysis. This, in essence, is a fundamental study at high solids, and the hope is that when sotnrasting it to the extensive work at lower loadings, it could highlight the key issues to voercome, and parameters to know, when doing hydorlysis at high solids. 
%
%To measure diffusivities at high solids, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is probably the ebst technique. At high solids, celluloci fibers form an opaque bed, making it hard to use optical techniques (fluorescence microscopy, confocal miscorpcopy). FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) is another popular technique for measuring diffucivity [CITE] but it is aimed at measuring self diffusivities, which would not work in this case. It might be useful however, to measure self diffusivity of Cel7A in order to compare it to what happens in high solids and elucidate the variables that arise then, but it's not great for the purposes of this study. In the past, MRI has been used effectively to measure diffusivities of contrast agents \citep{tozzi2012} and BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin, a protein) \citep{lavenson2012,roberts2011} in cellulosic fibers, making it a great candidate for measuring diffusivities of Cel7A. With a system set up with a relatively simple geomtry as shown before \citep{tozzi2012, lavenson2012, roberts2011}, MRI would be successful regardless of the concentration of fibers or enzymes used. 
%
 MRI relies on the differences between magnetic moments of nuclei in different parts of the imaged system \citep{choi2002} and is therefore independent of optical properties of the system. The key to imaging with MRI is to just be able to tell the enzymes apart from the fibers with the use of a contrast agent and/or a sequence that highlights these differences. In these past studies they used MnCl2 and Gd-BSA; both Mn and Gd are paramagnetic contrast agents, emaning that in the presence of a magnetic field they have a dipole moment, and this dipole moment affects the relaxation times of nearby protons. Gd is often used as an imaging tracer in blood [CITE]. In the case of the stuydies above, with the sequences they used, regions within the sample where these contrast agents were present had a hgiher signal intensity. The thing about MRI, with the reslution it has, it generally only shows the contrast of a general area, not individual molecules (enzyme size XXX, resolution of MRI XXX). For that reason, it's important to set up a simple enough geometry so that concentrations of tracked molecules can be measured and modeled (e.g., using Fick's law).
%
GdBSA is of particular interest and relevance to measuring the diffusivity of cellulases. At XXX in diameter, it's a mostly spherical protein [CITE], whose radius approximates the hydrodynamic radius of Cel7A, the most representative of all cellulases due to the composition of commercial cocktails [CITE]. Cel7A however, has two domains and a non-spherical gemoetry [CITE: Beckham] that means that approximating its diffusivity with a hydrodynamic radius may not be necessarily representative of the enzyme. In the studies done \citep{lavenson2012, roberts2011}, BSA also did not adsorb onto the cellulosic fibers, which would confound its diffusivity. Cel7A, on the other hand, adsorbs and hydrolyzes cellulsoe [CITE], so isolating diffusivity becomes more challenging, and modeling chnages in concentration throughout a fiber bed would require a more complex mass transport model that also accounts for adsorption and reaction kinetics.

% falls into two major areas: rheology during liquefaction of biomass, and liquefaction and hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass. 
The experimental work presented hereafter was done to understand rheological properties of biomass undergoing hydrolysis, and how these can be used to better understand process-relevant characteristics and develop an efficient method for high-solids hydrolysis of biomass. To this end, magnetic resonance flow imaging was used to characterize both the complex rheology of cellulosic slurries and how that rheology changes during enzymatic hydrolysis. Each individual study shed light on a different aspect of cellulose rheology during liquefaction, and these characterization studies will hopefully serve to better understand biomass hydrolysis and enable scale-up of this step. After detailed descriptions of the methodology (Chapter \ref{ch:methods}) used throughout this work, the following two chapters (Chapters \ref{ch:wheat-rheology}-\ref{ch:egxyl}) are from work done at UC Davis with researchers from the University of Copenhagen, the second of which is published in a peer-reviewed journal. This work was done to characterize the rheology of a lignocellulosic substrate under various enzyme treatments. The last three chapters (Chapters \ref{ch:fed-batch}-\ref{ch:end-product}) are from experiments I performed to study the hydrolysis of a model cellulosic substrate under various processing conditions to optimize liquefaction and determine rate-limiting characteristics. The work presented in Chapter \ref{ch:fed-batch} using rheology monitoring for fed-batch hydrolysis is based on a patented process for which I am the lead inventor. A final conclusions chapter (Chapter \ref{ch:conclusions}) is included to summarize the main takeaways from all this work, as well as to outline directions for future work. 

%[STUFF BELOW MIGHT BELONG IN OUTLINE/MOTIVATION WAY BELOW]
The goal of these studies was to enable high-solids hydrolysis of biomass by both developing a process with high solids loadings in mind, and expanding the current understanding of the ``solids effects'' that arise to figure out how to overcome them. This work focuses on the use of MRI rheometry to understand rheological properties of cellulosic slurries, and how those properties change over the course of enzymatic hydrolysis. Monitoring rheology in real time during hydrolysis can provide insight on some of the kinetics of the process, as those rheological changes are due to enzymatic action of endoglucanases \citep{szijarto2011}, but may not necessarily be directly tied to saccharification. Thus, links between rheology and kinetics are elucidated, and how these links may affect scale-up of the process are discussed. Some of the ``solids effects'' are also studied by recreating those inhibitory conditions in the flow loop system and seeing the response to determine the nature of the limitations of the process.

%the first two chapters were from work done at UC Davis in conjunction with researchers from the VTT Technical Research Centre in Finland to utilize MRI, UVP (ultrasound velocimetry...), and OCT (optical cohrenece tomography) to fully characterize the flow of various suspensions, from the viscous boundary layter region, to the bulk region.

Motivation
In biomass hydrolysis, there are a lot changes occurring both at the local and at the bulk scales, both of which are equally important in painting a full picture of this heteregeneous reaction. In developing a kinetic model of this process, there is still work to be done, and the first step is developing a clear understanding of how enzymes hydrolyze biomass and what makes hydrolysis slow down over time. In the work presented hereafter, all studies were done to enable high-solids hydrolysis of biomass by looking at different physicochemical properties that are changing at the bulk scale to see what is important and what can be controlled to make the process more scalable. Various studies were done to understand the rheology of cellulosic suspensions and how they change during hydrolysis, as well as how different enzyme treatments, under different conditions, with different biomass sources impact hydrolysis yields and rates to get a comprehensive view of high-solids hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass, especially during the first hour of hydrolysis when liquefaction occurs. Studies done with fed-batch setups are first attempts at optimizing this process in a scalable manner. MRI provides a unique way to study all these conditions, as it allows for non-invasive, real-time quantitative and qualitative data to be obtained, shedding light on process-relevant characteristics and process-relevant issues, like pumpability and mixability of a slurry. Overall, the goal was to test some of the properties that affect hydrolysis kinetics at high solids, and to see how the system responds in order to enable scale-up in order to begin elucidating which characteristics really matter for scale-up and reactor design.

Biomass hydrolysis is only one of the steps required in biomass conversion to biofuels. These fundamental studies are useful in helping to scale up and reduce the cost of this step in the process, which will get us closer to the goal of commercialization of biomass-derived biofuels. However, there are still significant challenges present in scaling up every step of the process to make this an economically viable endeavor for sustainable energy. The work in this dissertation will add depth to our understanding of biomass rheology, particularly during liquefaction, and hopefully enable new means by which to further optimize this process.

\chapter{Methodology} \label{ch:methods}
All experiments described throughout this dissertation (unless explicitly stated otherwise) were done in a recycle-flow reactor (flow loop) coupled with Magnetic Resonance Imaging velocimetry. That setup and experimental techniques used throughout are described in detail here. Details specific to each study are detailed in the corresponding chapters.

\section{ Rheological characterization }
In all studies, the rheological changes in biomass undergoing enzymatic hydrolysis under different processing conditions were characterized. The cellulosic and lignocellulosic suspensions consisted of buffer and biomass at a given consistency. These suspensions were added to the flow loop system described below and previously demonstrated by \citet{lavenson2011,tozzi2014,mccarthy1992,maneval1996,arola1997,arola1999}, and others. The composition of the suspensions studied are described in each chapter in detail.

\subsection{ Flow loop setup }
%[REMOVE VTT REFS]
Figure \ref{fig:flowloop} shows a schematic of the flow loop setup and all its components. A similar setup was described and used by \citet{tozzi2014,skovgaard2014} for enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass. The setup as described by \citet{skovgaard2014} was used for all experiments on wheat straw (Chapters \ref{ch:wheat-rheology} and \ref{ch:egxyl}). All experiments on Solka-Floc (Chapters \ref{ch:fed-batch}-\ref{ch:end-product}) were done on a modified version of the flow loop setup with automated pressure data acquisition, and this setup is described below. Conceptually, all setups worked similarly, and the schematic shown in Figure \ref{fig:flowloop} is applicable to all, but some components were changed depending upon the experiment.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{extras/setup}
  \caption[Flow loop system setup used for all studies.]{Flow loop system setup used for all studies. Its components include a 10 L tank (A), an impeller mixer (B), a positive displacement pump (C), a heat exchanger (D), a pressure transducer (connected at E and G), MRI magnet and spectrometer (F), and an in-line thermocouple for temperature monitoring (H).}
  \label{fig:flowloop}
\end{figure}

The flow loop system was essentially a 10 L recycle-flow reactor coupled with components to ensure isothermal conditions and to monitor rheological changes during hydrolysis. The stainless steel mixing tank (A) was the only open section in the system, and it was where suspension components were loaded and hydrolyzate samples were obtained. The tank was fitted with a mixer (B) (PolyScience Mixer PSC 10, PolyScience, Niles, IL) with an impeller with 1-inch blades (McMaster-Carr, Elmhurst, IL). The suspension was pumped continuously by a Moyno positive displacement pump (C)(Moyno Inc., Springfield, OH) at a flow rate of 9 L/min (unless stated otherwise). The suspension was then pumped into a heat exchanger comprised of a stainless steel coil (with four turns) submerged in a 23 L thermostatic water bath (D) (PolyScience 9610) to maintain reaction temperature. Temperature was also continuously monitored (H) in-line with a type K thermocouple connected to a temperature controller and display (Omega Engineering Inc., Stamford, CT); this readout was used to adjust the heat exchanger's set point temperature.

MRI acquisitions of flow profiles occurred in the main section of the lines (E-G). Pipe fittings in this section were 1 in ID stainless steel fittings with tri-clamp connections (Brewer's Hardware, Huntington Beach, CA). The line section inside the MRI bore was a threaded PVC pipe with $\frac{3}{4}$-inch ID (McMaster-Carr). Velocity profiles of the continuously flowing suspensions were acquired via MRI (F) with a Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo sequence (PGSE) as detailed below. Imaging parameters were adjusted to maximize signal-to-noise ratio and contrast. To obtain full rheograms of the suspensions, velocity data was coupled with pressure drop data. For pressure data acquisition, a Siemens pressure transducer with a maximum range of 20 PSI (Branom Instrument Co., Seattle, WA) was used. The sanitary diaphragm seals where the pressure sensors were located were connected to 1-inch ID stainless steel instrument tees (Brewer's Hardware) at E and G, 1.32 m apart. Differential pressure data acquisition was automated as follows: data from the pressure transducer was continuously transmitted via a National Instruments Data Acquisition card (USB-6009 Multifunction I/O, National Instruments, Austin, TX) to a PC, and data points were collected every 2 seconds based on averaging of 1000 points with a MATLAB script (MathWorks, Natick, MA). See Appendix \ref{ch:appendix2} for MATLAB scripts used for pressure acquisition and post-processing.

\subsection{Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) velocimetry and rheometry}
In-line rheological measurements during experiments were performed \textit{in situ} and non-invasively using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) flow loop as previously demonstrated \citep{maneval1996,mccarthy1992,lavenson2011,skovgaard2014,tozzi2014}. An Aspect Imaging 1.03 T permanent magnet with a 0.3 T/m peak gradient strength (Aspect Imaging, Hevel Modi'in Industrial Area, Shoham, Israel) was used to obtain all images used in rheological analyses. The radio frequency coil encasing the imaging section of the pipe was a solenoid with either three turns enclosing a volume 38 mm in diameter and 36 mm long, or four turns enclosing a volume 60 mm in diameter and 60 mm long. Velocity profiles as a function of radial position of the flowing suspensions were obtained throughout all experiments using a Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) sequence \citep{maneval1996,powell1994}. The PGSE sequence uses phase-encoded and frequency-encoded magnetic field gradients to obtain velocity and position data, respectively. All frequency and phase gradients used had 128 encoding steps. Flow imaging parameters (echo time TE, repetition time TR, velocity sweep width VSW, number of averages) were varied so as to obtain high contrast and signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting $128x128$ matrix was transformed with a 2D Fourier transform into a matrix of signal intensities. Velocity at each radial position was given by the maximum signal intensity in each row of the matrix (row: velocity, column: radial position). All data analysis was done using MATLAB.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5in]{extras/sample_MRI}
  \caption[MRI rheometer data acquisition sample.] {Sample of MRI rheometer data acquisition. A) Flow image, where the high contrast region is the velocity profile, given as velocity (vertical axis) as a function of radial position (horizontal axis). B) Velocity versus radial position is obtained from the maximum velocity in each column of the $128*128$ signal intensity matrix used to generate (A). The derivative of the velocity profile can then be used to obtain shear rates ($\dot{\gamma}$). Differential pressure data is used to obtain shear stresses ($\tau$) (C) and apparent viscosities ($\eta$) (D).}
  \label{fig:MRIdata}
\end{figure} 

These velocity profiles, in conjunction with in-line differential pressure measurements, were used to obtain yield stresses during experiments as shown previously \citep{tozzi2014,lavenson2011}. Shear rates were obtained from the derivative of the velocity profile, $\dot{\gamma} = |\frac{-dv}{dr}|$. Shear stresses were calculated as $\tau = \Delta P*R/2L$, obtained from dimensional parameters (pipe radius $r$ and pipe length between pressure acquisition points $L$) and in-line pressure drop measurements ($\Delta P$). Yield stress is the shear stress at zero shear rate. An example of MRI data analysis is shown in Figure \ref{fig:MRIdata}, going from velocity profile to rheogram. Data from images was converted to velocity data as shown by Choi et al. \citep{choi2005,choi2002,choi2003}.

\section{ Enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass }
Experiments on the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass were performed in the flow loop setup described above to obtain real-time rheological data during liquefaction. In most studies, a 50 mM sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.0 was added to the stainless steel tank feeding into the flow loop and was allowed to circulate to reach reaction temperature (usually 50 \degree C). Temperature was controlled and maintained by a heat exchanger in the flow loop and insulation on the lines throughout trials to avoid deviations >1 \degree C. In-line temperature was also continuously monitored to ensure isothermal conditions. Once the buffer was pre-heated, cellulosic or lignocellulsic fibers, and cellulases (various sources) were fed into the flow loop at the given solids and enzyme loadings. 

\subsection{ Hydrolyzate characterization }
Throughout hydrolysis experiments, hydrolyzate samples were collected from the return line of the flow loop for off-line characterization. Samples were collected in 15 ml conical tubes, and placed in a water bath at 90 \degree C for 10-20 minutes to quench enzymatic activity. Samples were then stored at -20 \degree C until further analysis.

\subsubsection{ Total solids analysis }

Total solids fractions were measured using both a Halogen Mettler Toledo Moisture Analyzer (model HR83, Mettler-Toledo International, Inc., Columbus, OH) and a vacuum oven drying method as shown by \citet{weiss2010} to derive insoluble solids contents (when reported). In the Moisture Analyzer, samples were heated to 105 \degree C until there was <0.05\% change in the weight of the sample, at which point the total solids fraction was determined based on the weight of water that evaporated.

\subsubsection{ Sugar analysis with High Performance Liquid Chromatography }

Hydrolyzate samples were analyzed for soluble sugars by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD). Prior to analysis, the liquid fraction was separated from the solid fraction by centrifugation (Centrifuge 5804R, Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) at 7,000 RPM for 10 minutes. Supernatants were then filtered using a 0.45 $\mu$m syringe filter. In some experiments, the hydrolyzates were further diluted in nanopure water if the concentrations of products were high to avoid saturation during detection. Unless stated otherwise, separation was carried out on an Aminex HPX-87P column with de-ashing and Carbo-P guard cartridges (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and sugar concentrations were measured by refractive index. The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min at 80 \degree C using nanopure water as the mobile phase. Calibration was performed with standard solutions of \textsc{D}-glucose, \textsc{L}-arabinose, \textsc{D}-xylose, \textsc{D}-mannose, \textsc{D}-galactose and \textsc{D}-cellobiose.

\subsubsection{ Glucan conversion in high-solids hydrolysis }

Glucose yields in some experiments (Chapters \ref{ch:fed-batch}-\ref{ch:end-product}) were determined as per \citet{zhu2011}, which was found fit for calculating yields for experiments performed at high solids loadings, in which the density of the liquid phase and the liquid volume in the reactor would be changing during the reaction. Glucose yields were calculated as follows,

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:conv_methods}
Y_g=\frac{C_{g}\cdot V_{h}- C_{g,0}\cdot V_{h,0}}{\phi_{G}\cdot W_{t}\cdot f_{ts,0} \cdot X_{is,0}+\phi_{gos}\cdot C_{gos,0}\cdot V_{h,0}},
\end{equation}

where $Y_{g}$ is the glucose yield (as a fraction of 100), $C_{g}$ and $C_{g,0}$ are concentrations of glucose (g/L), $V_{h}$ and $V_{h,0}$ are volumes of the hydrolyzate (L), $\phi_{G}$ is the molecular weight ratio of glucose to glucan monomer (1.11), $W_{t}$ is the total weight of the hydrolysis assay (g), $f_{ts,0}$ is the initial mass fraction of total solids, $X_{is,0}$ is the initial mass fraction of insoluble solids in total solids (i.e., $f_{is,0}/f_{ts,0}$), $\phi_{gos}$ is the molecular weight ratio of glucose to average monomer weight of glucose oligomers (1.08), and $C_{gos,0}$ is the initial concentration of glucose oligomers (g/L) \citep{zhu2011}. All terms in Equation \ref{eqn:conv_methods} with subscript `0' correspond to initial values (at the beginning of hydrolysis or a hydrolysis batch, dependent upon setup). In fed-batch setups, these changed with each batch addition and thus all reported glucose yields account for the changing amount of biomass in the reactor. Fraction of insoluble solids ($f_{is,0}$) was calculated based on the measured fraction of total solids ($f_{ts,0}$) and by using the method detailed by \citet{weiss2010}. Equation \ref{eqn:fis_methods} details how $f_{is,0}$ was calculated,

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:fis_methods}
f_{is}=\frac{f_{ts}-y_{ss}}{1-y_{ss}},
\end{equation}

where $y_{ss}$ is the mass fraction of soluble solids in the liquid fraction of the slurry, or $m_{ss}/m_{l}$ (dimensionless), and $m_{ss}$ is the total mass of soluble solids (g) and $m_{l}$ is the total mass of liquid in the slurry (g). Density of the slurry was approximated based on substrate and hydrolyzate composition. Total solids and sugar concentration measurements were thus used to obtain glucose yields for high-solids hydrolysis experiments.



\chapter{Comparison between MRI, UVP, OCT }

In this work, we use optical coherence tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and pulse ultrasound Doppler velocimetry to measure velocity profiles through a horizontal pipe for flowing water, aqueous xanthan gum solution, and fibre suspensions. 

\subsection{Velocity Measurement Techniques for Profiling Viscometry}

\subsubsection{Ultrasound Doppler Velocimetry}
Ultrasound Doppler Velocimetry (UDV) is a  relatively simple, non-intrusive acoustic measurement technique. Also, in the literature, the terms ultrasound velocity profiling (UVP) and ultrasound pulse doppler (UPD) refer to variations of this technique and measurement method. The origin of UDV dates three decades back in the medical field where it was applied to measure blood flow. UDV is based on using an emitter-receiver probe to send a series of short ultrasound bursts into the flow, and detecting the echoes issuing from the target particles moving along with the flow. The spatial location of the particles is acquired with the time-of-flight method using the known velocity of sound in the flowing medium

\begin{equation}
d=c\tau/2
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is the time interval between transmitting and receiving the ultrasound signal.
The velocity at a given position is a function of the Doppler shift frequency $f_{D}$ and speed of sound $c$ in the sample through the following relationship
\begin{equation}
v=(cf_{D})/(2*f_{0}*cos(\theta))
\end{equation}
where $f_{0}$ is the ultrasound emitter frequency and $\theta$ is the Doppler angle. The Doppler angle is defined as the complement of the angle of inclination of the ultrasound beam and the direction of main velocity vector of the moving target particles (pipe wall). Thus, UDV measures the velocity component in the direction of the ultrasound beam. The cross-section of measurement volume, in which the velocity is acquired, can be considered as disk-shaped with effective dimensions determined by the probe's piezoelectric element generating the ultrasonic pulse train. The diameter and shape of the measurement volume changes along the measurement axis as the ultrasound beam is diverged. The thickness of the measurement volume is determined by the number of the cycles within the ultrasonic pulses as
\begin{equation}
v=(c*N)/(2*f_{0})
\end{equation}.  
For example, the length of an ultrasound pulse with a frequency of 4 MHz and a length 2 cycles correspond to a physical length of ~ 0.375 mm in water.

If the ultrasound travels through e.g. a pipe wall, the initial angle changes according to the law of refraction. The determination of the spatial locations can be corrected knowing the properties and dimensions of the acoustic coupling and wall material.

In practice, the velocity of the target particles is calculated from the cross-correlation between the echoes from the emitted pulse train.  

\subsubsection{ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging }
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a technique that uses the interaction between magnetic moments in the nuclei of a sample and an applied external magnetic field to obtain structural, spatial, and translational molecular data. 

\subsubsection{ Optical Coherence Tomography }
The spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), used in this work, is a fusion of laser Doppler velocimetry and optical coherence tomography. In the SD-OCT, a light beam of low coherence is emitted from a super luminescent led light source and split into the sample arm and the reference arm of the Michelson interferometer. The backscattered interference pattern carries information about the sample scattering index from different depths inside the sample. Two-dimensional slice images can be constructed from a series of adjacent lateral scans. In Doppler OCT mode, the velocity data can be acquired using Kasai autocorrelation function for the adjacent scans(Kasai). 


\section{ Materials and Methods }
\subsection{Materials}
Warm tap water was cooled down to room temperature overnight for reducing the gas content of the water. The xanthan gum solution was prepared in the water by adding an amount equalling concentration of 0.01\%. The used xanthan gum (XG) type was Ticaxan manufactured by TicGums. The average molecular weight of XG was approximately 6 million Daltons. For the optical velocity measurements, a small amount of coffee creamer (1-2\% by volume, Nestle Coffee-mate) was added as a light scattering tracer. Notice that the coffee creamer is not an appropriate tracer for ultrasound and thus the UDV measurements with water and xanthan solution were omitted. 

Fully bleached softwood kraft pulp (BSK) samples were provided by a Finnish pulp mill as dried sheets. The length-weighted mean fibre length was XXX mm. The pulp was disintegrated in deionised water, firstly by soaking for several hours and then under high intensity mixing with an overhead stirrer (Glas-Col Precision Stirrer). The tests were performed with a fibre mass concentration of 0.42\%.

The microfibrillated cellulose was obtained from Daicel Chemical Industries (Japan). The product type was Celish\textsuperscript{\textregistered} KY-100G, which is manufactured from purified wood pulp. The properties of the MFC have been reported in the literature. The average length and diameter of the fibres are 350 and 15 §mm, respectively \cite{Tatsumi}. Although the fibre diameters are quite large, the size distribution of the fibrils ranges from microscale to nanoscale. Prior to the measurements, the cellulose samples were diluted with deionised water under high intensity mixing with an overhead stirrer (Glas-Col). The mass concentration measured with a Halogen Mettler Toledo Moisture Analyzer (model HR83, Mettler-Toledo International, Inc., Columbus, OH) was 0.40\%.

\subsection{ Pipe flow system }
The measurement unit consisted of a 2.5 m long optical grade glass pipe with an inner diameter of 19 mm. The flow in the pipe was driven using a low-pulsation progressive cavity pump (Seepex MD series). Total volume of the sample in the flow loop and in the tank was 13.5 litres. The fluid temperature in the loop was set to 21 $^{\circ}$C with a digital temperature controller (PolyScience, model 9610).
The volumetric flow rate in the loop was adjusted manually using the pump control voltage. The flow rate was measured with a magnetic flow meter (Siemens, Sitrans F M MAGFLO) and used as a reference for the comparison studies. The fluid temperature during each trial point was measured manually with a thermocouple (Fluke multimeter). The wall shear stress at each flow rate was found based on pressure difference measurement between two 1.5 mm diameter taps drilled through the pipe wall located at 74 and 126 diameters downstream from the pipe inlet. The pressure difference measurement was done using calibrated sensors (Rosemount, sensor types 3051 and 2051).

\subsection{ Velocity Profiling Equipment and Setup }

A DOP2000 (Signal-Processing S.A., Switzerland) instrument was used for the ultrasound Doppler velocity profiling (UDV) measurements. An ultrasound probe with 4 MHz frequency and 5 mm active piezo element was installed in a water bath surrounding the pipe. The angle between the probe axis and the pipe wall was 78.5$^{\circ}$. To avoid measuring velocity profiles in the region where the emitted ultrasound waves are irregular, the distance between probe and the pipe surface was set larger than the near field distance (ca. 17 mm). The length of a single ultrasound pulse was set to 2 cycles. corresponding to a pulse length of ~ 0.375 mm in water. The ultrasound pulse repetition frequency was varied between 500 Hz and 2000 Hz in order to exploit the full velocity resolution range, which is done with 8 bit dynamics in the used instrument. The calculated spatial resolution of the UDV profiles was 0.XX mm meaning that single velocity values are measured with this interval. In all the measurements, 32 consecutive pulse emissions were used to calculate a single velocity value in each sampled depth locations. 

A series of 500 individual UDV velocity profiles was recorded for each flow rate, and the final mean velocity profile was calculated as an average of these. The determination of the spatial locations of the velocity profile were corrected according to \cite{Wang}. In the correction method, the Doppler angle and measuring location are determined taking into account the ultrasound refraction and the ultrasound velocity difference in different medias, i.e. in the water bath, inside the pipe wall and in the flowing medium. The speed of sound was assumed to be 1500 m/s and 3962 m/s in water and glass, respectively.

With MRI, velocity profiles were acquired by using a velocity encoded Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) sequence \cite{arola1999,arola1997,choi2002,choi2003}. The PGSE sequence uses phase-encoded and frequency-encoded magnetic field gradients to obtain velocity and radial position, respectively. For these measurements, an Aspect Imaging 1 T MRI spectrometer with a peak gradient strength of 0.3 T/m was used. The radio frequency coil enclosing the pipe was a solenoid with 4 turns, 60 mm in diameter and 60 mm long. For all images, a slice thickness of 30 mm and a field of view (FOV) of 30 mm were used.

A paragraph about MRI data post processing details.

The OCT device used in this study was Telesto Spectral Domain OCT (Thorlabs, Inc) with a central wavelength of 1325 nm and bandwidth in excess of 150 nm. The resolution in the axial (beam) direction in water is better than 5 §mm. The device was connected to a master PC for control and data acquisition with system software version 3.2 by Thorlabs. The OCT was utilised for measuring the velocity profile in the Doppler OCT mode. The device was set to acquire sequential axial scans in a single physical position with a Doppler angle of 4-5$^{\circ}$ The Doppler angle was determined from B-scan images composed of 4096 A-scans in a spatial range of 5.00 mm.

Depending on the flow rate, the frequency of the OCT A-scans was either 5.5, 28 or 91 kHz. Higher A-scan frequencies increase the maximum detectable velocity but decrease the system sensitivity. A flat surface was machined on the pipe outer surface to minimise the glass thickness and to prevent undesired refraction on the outer surface. The post-processing and analysis of the phase-shift (velocity) data was performed in Matlab. A series of 15x4096 A-scans was analysed for each flow rate and used to calculate the mean velocity profile.  

The velocity measurements had to be performed in different locations of the pipe due to the physical size and positioning of the equipment. However, independent measurements of the pressure drop and flow rate allow normalisation and thus better comparison of the different velocity profiling techniques. The MRI measurement location was 44 pipe diameters from the flow inlet. The UDV and OCT measurements were performed 105 and 116 diameters from the inlet, respectively. Both UDV and OCT probe were installed horizontally to minimise distortions caused by e.g. sedimentation or air bubbles.The experimental flow loop with the measurement locations are shown in Figure \ref{fig:flowsystem}. A summary of the performed experiments is presented in Table 1.

\end{figure}

\section{Results}
The measured axial mean velocity profile data obtained with OCT, UVP and MRI techniques are presented, compared and discussed for the different studied materials, concentrations and flow rates. Prior to the velocity data, results from the pressure drop measurements are presented and discussed.

\subsection{Pressure Drop and Flow Rate}
Pressure drop as a function of flow rate can be used to indicate the type of flow was achieved for different materials in pipe flow.  With water the flow rate range achieved with the pump was 8--160 ml/s equalling Reynolds numbers of approximately 600--11000 (see Figures \ref{fig:dp_vs_Q} and \ref{fig:q_dP_error}). Excluding the transition range, the measured pressure drop generally deviates less than 3\% from the theoretical value. In the laminar region the theoretical pressure drop was calculated using XXX and in the turbulent region the pressure drop was obtained from XXX. 
The relative standard deviations of the pressure drop (std(dP/m)/(dP/m)) and volume flow rate (std(Q)/Q) are shown in Figure \ref{fig:q_dP_error}. According to the results, the flow conditions in the test section appear steady. As expected, the deviation of the pressure drop increases significantly in transition to turbulence and levels off again once the turbulent flow region (Re>4000) is reached.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{comparison/q_vs_dP_water_xanthan}
  \caption{Pressure drop as a function of flow rate for water and xanthan solution. Theoretical pressure drop for water is shown with solid line}
  \label{fig:dp_vs_Q}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{comparison/q_dP_error}
  \caption{Pressure drop as a function of Reynolds number for water. Theoretical pressure drop for water is shown with dashed lines}
  \label{fig:q_dP_error}
\end{figure}

In the presence of xanthan gum, drag reduction in the turbulent flow region is expected.
The percentage drag reduction is calculated using the measured pressure drop values as 
\begin{equation}
\%DR=100x(dP_{water}-dP_{XG})/dP_{water}
\end{equation}.
The maximum \%DR of 35.5 was obtained with water Reynolds numbers of 3900--4200 after approximately 120 minutes from the trial start. The \%DR value is in good agreement with the corresponding ones found in the literature \cite{Abdulbari}. With higher Reynolds numbers and in course of time noticeable decrease in \%DR is observed due to polymer degradation.

Several studies have been conducted on the pressure drop in the pipe flow of pulp suspensions (References). For unidirectional, axisymmetric flow in circular pipe, the total shear stress at the pipe wall is tau=r/2*dP/L. According to equation provided by Raiskinmäki and Kataja the disruptive shear stress for 0.45\% pine suspension is 4.1 Pa \cite{Raiskinmaki}. Since the shear stress at the wall with the highest shear rate is only 1.11 Pa, it is expected that the flow remains in the plug flow regime. For MFC the disruptive shear stress values for 0.3\% and 0.5\% MFC suspensions have been reported to be approximately 0.8 Pa and 2 Pa, respectively. In these measurements, the highest wall shear stress range of 0.57--2.49 Pa is thus expected to cover the disruptive flow regime of 0.40\% MFC suspension.

  \caption{Pressure drop as a function of flow rate for MFC and BSK.}
  \label{fig:q_vs_dP_MFC}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Velocity profiles}

A series of flow rates was applied in the measurement unit and a sequence of axial scans was again recorded in the same physical position. The Doppler angle of the measurement was 86$^{\circ}$. The data was utilised to determine the streamwise mean velocity profile by applying unwrapping algorithm for the gaussian velocity distributions. The presented experimental setup allowed velocities to be determined across XXX to XXX m/s in the vicinity of the pipe wall. The velocity profiles could be built up over a distance range of XXX microns to approximately XXX microns. The profile span was limited by the mass concentration and the flow velocity.

\chapter{ Boundary layer characterization }

Pulp fibre wall consists of a natural composite material comprised of cellulose microfibrils. Lately, there has been a growing interest towards disintegrating the fibre structure to its elementary fibrils, thereby producing natural raw stock for novel materials \cite{klemm2011}. Wood pulp can be disintegrated with mechanical shearing possibly augmented with chemical and enzymatic treatments. The produced fibrils, called micro (nano) fibrillated cellulose fibres (MFC), have nanoscale diameters and length of several micrometers (Vartiainen et. al. 2011). Similar to other natural and synthetic fibre suspensions, the rheological and flow properties of aqueous MFC suspensions are diverse, and depend strongly on the fibre properties and fibre mass concentration. The general characteristics of suspensions of relatively simple fibres can, to some extent, be classified in terms of Crowding number which depends on concentration, dimensions and material density of fibres, and correlates with the mean number of contacts between fibres in the suspension \cite{kerekes1992, kerekes1995}. Such classification is not applicable in MFC suspensions.  

As an aqueous suspension ($<$2 \% (w/w)), MFC has interesting rheological properties, for example, gel formation at a very low concentration, thixotropy, and shear-thinning behaviour \cite{klemm2011, paakko2007, nechyporchuk2014}. These properties derive primarily from the inherent entangled network formed during the disintegration of fibres into fibrils and are quite different from e.g. those of wood fibres. The MFC fibrils have very high specific surface area, aspect ratio, strength and flexibility which together with partially disintegrated fibres strengthen the network within the suspensions \cite{paakko2007}. 


Rheometric methods utilizing velocity profiling are based on measuring the actual flow velocity profile and wall shear stress simultaneously. The techniques applicable especially for optically turbid media are typically based on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NMRI) \cite{maneval1996, fukushima1999, cheung1997, powell1994} or Ultrasound-Doppler Velocity Profilometry (UVP) [11-15]. Both UVP and NMRI have been tested for several rheologically complex fluid and multiphase systems of practical interest in e.g. in food \cite{mccarthy1992}, paper and chemical industry. The concept is well established and has been implemented as in-line rheometers in industrial processes providing means for process monitoring and quality control [9- 15] \cite{mccarthy1992, arola1997}.
Velocity profiling with UVP and NMRI allows replacing an assumed velocity field by an actually measured profile in analysing the data for rheological properties of the fluid due to the pointwise measurements. However, due to their limited spatial resolution and, especially for UVP, disturbance caused by the tube wall - fluid interface [17-19], these methods are hardly accurate enough to resolve the flow profile in the immediate vicinity of the tube wall, where e.g. apparent slip can occur. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive technique capable of fast real-time high-resolution imaging of the internal structure of an opaque scattering medium in the vicinity of its surface. The imaging depth of OCT is limited by the attenuation of light in the material, and can be up to 2.5 mm in air. In addition to giving access of structural data, the method can provide velocity information. Furthermore, the OCT method appears capable of accurate high-resolution measurement of velocity profile very close to a channel wall, and is thus well suited in detailed study of the boundary layer flow behaviour of complex fluids with appropriate optical properties [24].



In this work we report results on rheological and boundary layer flow properties of a microfibrillated cellulose suspension, obtained by a novel in-line rheological method utilizing velocity profiling. The velocity profiles are measured by combining optical coherence tomography with two complementary methods, Ultrasound Velocity Profilometry (UVP) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Here, OCT is used to measure the velocity profile in the immediate vicinity of a transparent tube wall (typically closer than 0.5 mm), while UVP and MRI provide the same information in the interior parts of the tube. The combination of all these instruments provides then a complete velocity profile (i.e., containing both the boundary layer and bulk regions) of the MFC suspension, shedding light on some of the rheological and structural properties that have thus far not been measured. 

\section{ Materials and Methods }
\subsection{Materials}
The microfibrillated cellulose was obtained from Daicel Chemical Industries (Japan). The product type was Celish\textsuperscript{\textregistered} KY-100G, which is manufactured from purified wood pulp. The properties of the MFC have been reported in the literature. The average length and diameter of the fibres are 350 and 15 mm, respectively(Tatsumi). Although the fibre diameters are quite large, the size distribution of the fibrils ranges from microscale to nanoscale. Prior to the measurements, the cellulose samples were diluted with deionised water to mass concentrations of 0.40\%, 0.95\% and 1.53\% under high intensity mixing with an overhead stirrer (Glas-Col). 

\subsection{ Experimental Setup }
\subsubsection{P ipe flow system }
The measurement unit consisted of a 2.5 m long optical grade glass pipe with an inner diameter of 19 mm. The flow in the pipe was driven using a low-pulsation progressive cavity pump (Seepex MD series). Total volume of the sample in the flow loop and in the tank was 13.5 litres. The fluid temperature in the loop was set to 21 $^{\circ}$C with a digital temperature controller (PolyScience, model 9610).
The volumetric flow rate in the loop was adjusted manually using the pump control voltage. The flow rate was measured with a magnetic flow meter (Siemens, Sitrans F M MAGFLO).   

A series of flow rates was applied in the measurement unit. The flow rate range was 8--160 ml/s equalling Reynolds numbers of approximately 600--11000 (for water).The fluid temperature during each trial point was measured with a thermocouple (Fluke multimeter). The wall shear stress at each flow rate was found based on pressure difference measurement between two 1.5 mm diameter taps drilled through the pipe wall located at 74 and 126 diameters downstream from the pipe inlet. The pressure difference measurement was done using calibrated sensors (Rosemount, sensor types 3051 and 2051). A schematic of the pipe flow system is presented in Figure \ref{fig:flowsystem}.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Flow system scheme}
  \label{fig:flowsystem}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{ Optical Coherence Tomography }
The spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), used in this work, is a fusion of laser Doppler velocimetry and optical coherence tomography. In the SD-OCT, a light beam of low coherence is emitted from a super luminescent led light source and split into the sample arm and the reference arm of the Michelson interferometer. The backscattered interference pattern (A-scan) can be Fourier-transformed to give information about the sample scattering index from different depths inside the sample. In the SD-OCT system, the axial resolution is determined by the central wavelength and bandwidth of the light source. Contrary to standard microscopy, OCT can achieve good axial resolution independent of the beam focusing and spot size. The OCT device used in this study was Telesto Spectral Domain OCT (Thorlabs, Inc) with a central wavelength of 1325 nm and bandwidth in excess of 150 nm. The resolution in the axial (beam) direction in air is approximately 5 §mm and in water approx. 3.7 §mm. Cross-sectional images of the sample can be constructed from a series of A-scans by employing scanners to acquire depth profiles from different lateral locations of the sample. Such a collection of A-scans is called a B-scan. The lateral resolution of the OCT system is determined by the diffraction limited spot size of the focused optical beam, which in the utilised setup was 15 §mm.The  

In Doppler OCT mode, the Doppler frequency generated by moving objects is detected from the phase difference of two adjacent A-scans. The velocity data can be acquired using Kasai autocorrelation function for the adjacent scans(Kasai). 

The OCT was utilised in visualising the MFC suspension structure near the pipe wall as well as for measuring the velocity profile in the Doppler OCT mode. In the structure measurements the device was set to acquire sequential B-scans across a physical width of 5 mm. In the velocity measurements,  a sequence of A-scans was recorded in a single physical position. For the velocity profile measurements a small amount of coffee creamer was added as light scattering tracer in order to measure the velocities in the clear fluid regions. The axial resolution of the OCT is independent of the tracer concentration but increasing it may reduce the penetration depth of the light. Depending on the flow rate, the frequency of A-scans was 5.5, 28 or 91 kHz. The drawback with the higher A-scan frequency is the decrease in the system sensitivity. 

The OCT measurement location was xxx diameters downstream from the inlet. A flat surface was machined on the pipe outer surface to minimise the glass thickness and to prevent unwanted refraction at the outer surface. The OCT measurement setup is presented in Figure X. 

\subsubsection{ Ultrasound Velocity Profiling }
Ultrasound velocity profiling technique is based on using an emitter/receiver to send a series of short ultrasound bursts into the flow, and detecting the sound reflected from the target particles moving along with the flow. The location of the particles is acquired with the time-of-flight method using the known velocity of sound. The velocity of the moving particles is calculated from the cross-correlation between the echoes from consecutive pulses. Thus, analogously to OCT, UVP measures a single velocity component in the direction of the ultrasound beam. In the present study, a DOP2000 (Signal-Processing S.A., Switzerland) device equipped with a 4 MHz ultrasound probe was used. The probe was installed in a water bath surrounding the pipe XXX diameters downstream from the pipe inlet. The angle between the probe axis and the pipe wall was 78.5$^{\circ}$. The length of a single ultrasound pulse was set to 2 cycles corresponding to a pulse length of ~ 0.375 mm in water. The ultrasound pulse repetition frequency was varied between 500 and 1000 Hz in order to exploit the full velocity resolution range. With the used UVP device, the velocity data acquisition is done with 8 bit dynamics. In all measurements, 8 consecutive pulse emissions were used to calculate a single velocity value in each sampled depth locations. A series of 150 ? 500 individual velocity profiles was recorded for each flow rate, and the final mean velocity profile was calculated as an average of these.

\subsubsection{ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging }
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a technique that uses the interaction between magnetic moments in the nuclei of a sample and an applied external magnetic field to obtain structural, spatial, and translational molecular data. Velocity profiles were acquired with MRI by using a velocity encoded Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) sequence \cite{arola1999,arola1997,choi2002,choi2003}. The PGSE sequence uses phase-encoded and frequency-encoded magnetic field gradients to obtain velocity and radial position, respectively. For these measurements, an Aspect Imaging 1 T MRI spectrometer with a peak gradient strength of 0.3 T/m was used. The radio frequency coil enclosing the pipe was a solenoid with 4 turns, 60 mm in diameter and 60 mm long. The measurement location of the MRI was 44 diameters from the pipe inlet.


The Doppler angle of the measurement was 86$^{\circ}$. The data was utilised to determine the streamwise mean velocity profile by applying unwrapping algorithm for the gaussian velocity distributions. The presented experimental setup allowed velocities to be determined across XXX to XXX m/s in the vicinity of the pipe wall. The velocity profiles could be built up over a distance range of XXX microns to approximately XXX microns. The profile span was limited by the mass concentration and the flow velocity (These could be moved to results section). 





Rheological changes during hydrolysis of steam pretreated wheat straw}


In the biochemical pathway to convert plant-derived cellulose to fuel, the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose is one of the most expensive steps due to the challenges in handling and breaking down fibrous cellulosic slurries. In order to understand the rheological features of lignocellulosic biomass during hydrolysis, wheat straw pretreated by steam explosion at two different severities was hydrolyzed under various conditions, including two different temperatures, and different enzyme treatments. During liquefaction under all conditions, transitional annular flow profiles were observed that may indicate flocculation of the lignocellulosic fibers. In addition, hydrolysis outcomes due to changes in hydrolysis temperature and fiber pre-hydration were investigated, which may have an impact on scale-up process considerations.


The search for sustainable alternative sources of energy has put significant research focus on second generation biofuels, which are generated from the breakdown of plant cell wall material to its component sugars (i.e., glucose derived from cellulose). A potential abundant feedstock for this process is agricultural residue. Economic considerations for a viable biorefinery process require at least a 4\% (w/w) ethanol yield dowsntream from the hydrolysis step, which entails at least a 15\% (w/w) total solids composition in the hydrolysis step \citep{jorgensen2007,wingren2003}. Operating at such solids loadings, however, results in a highly non-Newtonian, shear-thinning suspension that can be difficult to pump and mix \citep{wikstrom1998}. Lignocellulosic biomass is fibrous in nature, which can complicate the rheology further. Fibrillar flocs can form as the biomass gets crowded in suspension, even at dilute concentrations \citep{kerekes1985,kerekes1992,fock2011,chen2003}. Slurries of microfibrilliated cellulose, only microns in size, can also exhibit thixotropic behavior (time-dependent shear-thinning behavior) \citep{klemm2011}. Complex rheologies like these can make large-scale processing of cellulosic biomass slurries challenging. 

Significant effort has gone into characterizing the rheology of lignocellulosic biomass, especially as a function of solids content \citep{stickel2009,lavenson2011,knutsen2009,ehrhardt2010,roche2009,pimenova2003,pimenova2004}. Studies where off-line rhoemetry was used, however, have often run into challenges due to biomass particle sizes and heterogeneity in the flow field \citep{knutsen2009}. Non-invasive in-line techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rheometry can be advantageous in characterizing such complex systems. MRI has been used in the past to characterize biomass suspension rheology \citep{lavenson2011} and hydrolysis \citep{tozzi2014,skovgaard2014}, as well as rheological phenomena like slip \citep{rofe1996}, settling \citep{altobelli1991,tozzi2013}, and flow ranging from laminar to turbulent regimes \citep{tozzi2013}. It is therefore a good technique to characterize the complex rheology of lignocellulosic biomass during hydrolysis, especially if any of these phenomena arise.

%In previous chapters, the rheology of nanocellulose was explored, where a concentration gradient was observed enar the wall, implying the fibruous materials may exhibit biphasic flow, with two different concnetrations extents in the boundary layer and bulk regions [CITE SANNA AND OTHERS?]. Lignocellulose is much larger in particle size, and similar behaviors might be expected. Lignocellulosic biomass, more so than delignified biomass, can be more polydisperse [CITE SOMEONE ON HOW POLYDISPERSE IS HARDER THAN MONO], and this makes high solids processing more difficult.

In this work, wheat straw (a lignocellulosic feedstock), steam pretreated at two different severities, was hydrolyzed at 6\% (w/w) solids by different enzyme treatments. Three different enzyme treatments were used: two mixtures --- a thermostable enzyme preparation (Thermomix) and a commercial enzyme preparation (Celluclast and Novozyme 188) ---, and purified endoglucanases. Overall trends in liquefaction and saccharification, as well as complex rheological features that arise during hydrolysis (and that are relevant for scale-up) are highlighted and discussed. In addition, some experiments were done at two different temperatures (45 \degree C and 55 \degree C) to evaluate the enzymatic activity and mass transport implications of temperature changes during a process. All experiments were performed in a continuously flowing recycle reactor coupled with a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) rheometer to continuously monitor rheological changes during liquefaction. Off-line sugar concentration measurements were also performed to quantify extent of hydrolysis. Finally, some wheat straw batches were allowed to hydrate overnight prior to experiments to determine the effect of biomass hydration (i.e., water absorption) on subsequent hydrolysis. 

Methods
Biomass
Hydrothermally pretreated wheat straw was obtained from Inbicon (Sk{\ae}rb{\ae}k, Denmark). The wheat straw was pretreated with steam in two different ways (different severities): 12 minutes at 184 \degree C (hereafter, ``WS184'') and 12 minutes at 195 \degree C (heareafter, ``WS195''). The water/straw ratio was 5:1 after pretreatment \citep{larsen2008,thomsen2006}. The wheat straw was then pressed to a final total solids content of 36\% (w/w) and stored at -20 \degree C. Wheat straw was thawed overnight prior to hydrolysis experiments. The total solids fraction was analyzed as per \citet{sluiter2010}. The compositions of ``WS184'' and ``WS195'' at the start of hydrolysis were 47.9\%  and 58.5\% glucan, 10.8\% and 5.3\% xylan, 29.5\% and 26.4\% lignin, and 5.1\% and 2.6\% ash, respectively.

\subsection{E nzymes }
Two different enzyme mixtures, a thermostable preparation (Thermomix, Roal Oy, Finland) and a mesostable commercial preparation (Celluclast and Novozyme 188, Novozymes, Bagsv{\ae}rd, Denmark) were used in these experiments. Thermomix contained 51\% cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) from \textit{Acremonium thermophillum}, 17\% cellobiohydrolase II (CBHII) from \textit{Chaetomium thermophillum}, and 13\% endoglucanase II (EG), 14\% endoxylanase (XYL), and 5\% $\beta$-glucosidase ($\beta$G) from \textit{Thermoascus aurantiacus}. These fractions are reported on a mass basis and were prepared by VTT (Finland). Celluclast and Novozyme 188 were used at a 5:1 ratio. In addition, some experiments were performed with purified endoglucanase II from Thermomix. For all experiments, the total protein concentration added was 10 mg enzyme/g-biomass.

\subsection{ Enzymatic activity assays }
The protein content of the enzyme mixtures was measured with a 2\% ninhydrin reagent as shown by \citet{skovgaard2013}. Filter paper (Whatman no. 1) activity (FPU) and endoglucanase activity were measured as described by \citet{ghose1987}, while endoxylanase activity was measured following \citet{bailey1992}. Filter paper activities were measured at 50 \degree C, and likely varied when hydrolysis experiments were run at 45 \degree C and 55 \degree C. Although enzymes were added on an enzyme concentration basis, their final FPU activities on a mass of protein basis were similar, indicating that at 10 mg enzyme/g-biomass, both mixtures had similar activities (see Table \ref{table:enz_act}).

\subsection{ Enzymatic hydrolysis with magnetic resonance imaging rheometry }
Batch enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were run in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) flow loop as described elsewhere (Chapter \ref{ch:methods}, \citet{skovgaard2014,tozzi2014}). A 50 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.9, was added to the flow loop and preheated until it reached 55-60 \degree C, at which point pretreated wheat straw was added to reach 6\% (w/w) total solids content. The wheat straw and buffer mixture was allowed to reach 45 \degree C or 55 \degree C (depending on trial conditions) and an in-line pressure drop of 4000 $\pm$ 10 Pa. Enzyme (10 mg-protein/g-biomass) was then added to start hydrolysis. Table \ref{table:ws_expts} details all experimental conditions used for these experiments.

\subsection{Hydrolyzate sample characterization}
Hydrolyzate samples (10-12 ml) were taken periodically for off-line sugar concentration analysis and, in some trials, fiber length characterization. Enzyme activity in samples was quenched by placing sample containers in a 90 \degree C water bath for 10 minutes. Samples were then stored at -20 \degree C until further analysis.

\subsubsection{Hydrolysis product characterization using High Performance Liquid Chromatography}
Soluble sugar concentrations were analyzed by a Dionex Summit HPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a Shimadzu refractive index detector (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD). Separation was performed in a Phenomenex Rezex ROA column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) at 80 \degree C with 5 mM \ce{H_2SO_4} as eluent at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Calibration was performed with standard solutions of \textsc{d}-glucose, \textsc{l}-arabinose, \textsc{d}-xylose, and \textsc{d}-cellobiose. Glucan conversion was calculated based on concentrations of glucose and cellobiose as shown by \citet{kristensen2009} and are reported as percentage of theoretical conversion.

\subsubsection{Fiber length measurements}
Wheat straw samples pretreated at 184 \degree C and 195 \degree C were analyzed for initial fiber length measurements. Image analysis of fiber dimensions in suspension were performed by Innventia (Stockholm, Sweden). The L{\&}W FiberTester used (Lorentzen and Wettre, Kista, Sweden) measured dimensions of particles consisting of one or more plant cells, which here are referred to as fibers. Fiber lengths refer to the longest dimension of solid particles. These may be (a segment of) an individual cell, or a few cells attached to each other. Around 80,000 fibers with a length between 15 $\mu$m and 7 mm were measured per sample. A description of the procedure is found in \citet{thygesen2011}. When mean fiber lengths are reported, it refers to a length-weighted average fiber length, $L_{LW}$, calculated as,

\begin{equation}
L_{LW}=\frac{\sum{(l_i n_i)l_i}}{\sum{n_i l_i}},
\label{eq:fiber_length}
\end{equation}  

where $l_i$ is the length class, and $n_i$ is the number of fibers belonging to that length class  \citep{tozzi2012}. Summations were done over all fibers measured in a sample. 

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Liquefaction and saccharification as decoupled processes}
Steam pretreated wheat straw, with two different severities of pretreatment, was hydrolyzed under a variety of conditions as detailed in Table \ref{table:ws_expts}. Three enzymatic treatments were used: two different mixtures (a thermostable mixture and a Celluclast and Novozyme 188 mixture) and purified endoglucanases. Figure \ref{fig:conv_liq} includes all liquefaction (A)  and saccharification (B) results for all trials at 55 \degree C.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5in]{wheat-rheology/conv_liq}
  \caption[Liquefaction and saccharification of wheat straw.]{A) Liquefaction and B) saccharification of wheat straw, steam pretreated at two different severities, hydrolyzed with a variety of enzyme treatments at 55 \degree C. Wheat straw was pretreated at 184 \degree C (black symbols) and at 195 \degree C (white symbols). Similar symbols indicate similar enzymatic treatments. Liquefaction for all trials reached steady state by two hours of hydrolysis, but conversion was highly dependent on the enzymes used.}
  \label{fig:conv_liq}
\end{figure}

Overall, liquefaction reached steady state by two hours of hydrolysis regardless of hydrolysis conditions. Faster liquefaction occurred in trials where the more severely pretreated wheat straw, WS195, was used (white symbols in Figure \ref{fig:conv_liq}A). WS195 fibers were generally shorter than WS184 (mean fiber length at start of hydrolysis was 278 $\mu$m and 508 $\mu$m for WS195 and WS184, respectively). Interestingly, liquefaction and saccharification with EG alone (squares in Figure \ref{fig:conv_liq}) proceeded at a similar rate and to a similar extent regardless of the substrate pretreatment. Liquefaction with enzyme mixtures (i.e., TT and CN), in contrast, did behave very differently depending on the pretreatment severity (compare triangles and circles of different colors in Figure \ref{fig:conv_liq}A). The initial accessibility of cellulases to cellulose affects hydrolysis rates and yields, and is susceptible to pretreatment severity \citep{jeoh2007,wiman2012}. Therefore, the extent of pretreatment likely affected the initial cellulose accessibility to cellulases, especially exoglucanases (present in the enzyme mixtures), which may be why no difference was seen in liquefaction or saccharification when only endoglucanases were used. 

Glucan conversion varied depending on enzymatic treatment. The lowest levels of conversion were with only EG used (7.5\% and 9.1\% on WS184-EG and WS195-EG, respectively), which is expected as those enzymes likely released mainly oligosaccharides and little soluble sugars. Among enzyme mixtures, the highest extents of hydrolysis were attained with TT on WS184 (39.3\% of theoretical, black circles in Figure \ref{fig:conv_liq}B) and the lowest with CN on WS195 (25.9\% of theoretical, white triangles in Figure \ref{fig:conv_liq}B). Thermostable enzymes can maintain their activity at and above 55 \degree C \citep{bhalla2013}, whereas Celluclast saccharifies optimally at lower temperatures (40 \degree C in studies by \citet{eklund1990}), thus it follows that conversion was less than optimal for the CN trials and optimal for the TT trials at 55 \degree C. For both substrates, TT at 55 \degree C hydrolyzed the highest amount of cellulose (26\% and 39.3\% on WS195-TT and WS184-TT, respectively). It is worth noting that for all trials with enzyme mixtures, conversions of WS184 (range: 32.9-39.3\% of theoretical) were higher than those of WS195 (range: 19.2-26.0\% of theoretical), the more severely pretreated substrate. This is in contrast with liquefaction trends, which showed that WS195 in general was liquefied faster than WS184. This again shows the decoupling of saccharification and liquefaction, since the substrate that liquefied faster (WS195) did not have higher levels of conversion. Past studies have shown that glucan conversion can increase with pretreatment severity, but at the cost of increased degraded sugars (e.g., furfurals) and loss of xylan recovery \citep{kabel2007}. It is possible that the more severe pretreatment caused the production of inhibitory compounds like furfural \citep{kumar2009} that resulted in a decrease in conversion under the hydrolysis conditions of WS195. WS195 may have been pretreated past the optimum for maximum cellulose digestibility without sugar degradation \citep{galbe2007}.

%Past studies found that glucan conversion increased with pretreatment severity \citep{kabel2007} , which is in contrast with the trends seen here. Furthermore, an optimal pretreatment severity exists for glucan conversion \citep{•}, and it may be that WS195 was pretreated past this point of optimum severity. 

%The differences in conversion between WS184 and WS195 become more apparent after 100 minutes of hydrolysis, which coincides with the steady state of liquefaction. 

%Pretreatment severity thus seems to affect different cellulases differently.

As shown previously on experiments with pretreated wheat straw, liquefaction and saccharification are clearly decoupled processes \citep{skovgaard2014}, as fast liquefaction did not lead to fast or high levels of conversion. Liquefaction reached steady state by two hours (120 minutes) of hydrolysis, whereas conversion continued to increase in trials with full enzyme mixtures, with the majority of conversion occurring past the steady state in liquefaction. The only cases in which conversion seemed to proceed on par with liquefaction were the trials in which only EG was used (squares in Figure \ref{fig:conv_liq}); liquefaction reached steady state by approximately 50 minutes of hydrolysis, which also appears to be steady state in conversion, with little increases over the following 4 hours of hydrolysis. Conversion in WS195-EG saw an increase of 4.9\% over the last 4 hours of hydrolysis, which is a larger increase than in WS184-EG (only a 2.7\% increase), but it was still a lower increase when compared to treatments with full enzyme mixtures. Kinetic modeling of hydrolysis, to be applicable to scaled-up processes, needs to account for both saccharification (sugar release) and substrate changes; accounting for yield stress or viscosity changes during liquefaction could be one way to account for substrate changes from a bulk-scale perspective. However, the interplay between liquefaction and saccharification is complicated, as it is highly reliant on the enzyme treatment used, as saccharification is mainly caused by exoglucanase activity and liquefaction is mainly caused by endoglucanase activity (as defined here). Monitoring concentrations of oligosaccharides released due to endoglucanase activity during hydrolysis would be one pathway to better understand the interplay between changes in viscosity and endoglucanase hydrolytic activity.

%correlate cellulose conversion with viscosity changes. 
%Further work would be needed to better understand which bulk-scale properties are most important to model mechanistic hydrolysis steps. 

\subsection{Complex rheology during wheat straw liquefaction}
The flow profiles of yield-stress fluids generally exhibit plug flow under pipe flow conditions. In the past, this has been observed in cellulosic biomass suspensions \citep{lavenson2011}. During liquefaction, the yield stress of biomass slurries is reduced \citep{tozzi2014}, which in flow profiles results in a reduction of the plug size \citep{lavenson2011}. Figure \ref{fig:hat_sample}B shows the typical progression in velocity profiles during liquefaction of Solka-Floc, a delignified cellulosic substrate (experiments in Chapter \ref{ch:eg}). The plug region in the center of the pipe gets smaller as time progresses. In contrast, during wheat straw liquefaction, a transitional flow profile was observed that seemed biphasic in nature, i.e., with two regions of different bulk rheological properties (Figure \ref{fig:hat_sample}A). These transitional annular profiles were observed during all wheat straw experiments. Figure \ref{fig:hat_sample}C shows what a typical biphasic, annular profile looked like using magnetic resonance imaging, and Figure \ref{fig:hat_sample}D is a diagram of a cross-section of the annular flow. All flow profiles were acquired under laminar flow conditions.

\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:hat_sample}A, the three main types of velocity profiles observed during wheat straw liquefaction are shown. At the start of liquefaction (squares in Figure \ref{fig:hat_sample}A), a mostly flat profile with plug flow was seen, with a region of slightly reduced velocity near the wall. This flow pattern will be referred to as ``full plug'' henceforth. This was followed by an annular, biphasic, flow profile (diamonds and circles in Figure \ref{fig:hat_sample}A). This annular flow profile was transitional as, a few minutes later, plug flow reemerged (triangles in Figure \ref{fig:hat_sample}A) with a flat region of constant velocity in the center section of the pipe and a more parabolic region in the near-wall (viscous) region of the pipe. All these transitions occurred prior to liquefaction steady state. For comparison, Figure \ref{fig:hat_sample}B shows velocity profiles at the same time points of liquefaction of Solka-Floc C100 at similar solids loadings (7.45\% versus 6\% for WS184), with a similar starting particle size (length: 0.444 mm and 0.508 mm for Solka-Floc C100 and WS184, respectively). With Solka-Floc, no transitional annular profiles were seen, and liquefaction was manifested mainly in changes in the size of the plug region. On average, the near-wall region of the biphasic flow profiles was approximately 2.4 mm in size, extending from $R/R$ to $0.75\cdot R/R$ (or $0.25*R$ in size), where $R$ is the radius of the pipe. 



Extensive research has gone into characterizing the flow of pulp fiber suspensions (see \citet{cui2007,derakhshandeh2011} for extensive reviews), and its features can be of relevance in lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysis.
Dilute and medium consistency fiber suspensions (<3\% (w/w)) exhibit flow phenomena similar to what was observed in wheat straw liquefaction. In both pipe flow \citep{robertson1957} and parallel plate rheometer studies \citep{chen2003}, distinct flow behaviors are seen at different shear rates. \citet{chen2003} measured the shear stress at various shear rates of kraft pulp at 0.05\% consistency and found a region at shear rates between 3 and 115 s$^{-1}$ wherein shear stresses jumped and were unstable; photographs of the suspension confirmed that the jumps were due to floc formation which are homogenized outside this shear rate range. In pipe flow, a similar trend was observed wherein floc formation was dependent on fluid velocity \citep{robertson1957}. At low velocities, fibers flow in a plug that slips against the pipe wall. As the velocity increases, an annulus of water appears near the wall. Finally, as the velocity continues to increase, the annulus increases in size and becomes turbulent, which contributes to homogenization of the fibers in the near-wall region. In a similar study by \citet{fock2011}, fibers were imaged with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) during flow at different velocities, and the appearance of a water annulus was coupled with the appearance of large, heterogeneous fiber flocs that disappear as the fluid velocity increases and particles align with the flow field. In the case of wheat straw liquefaction, the pump speed was not changed over the course of hydrolysis, but enzymatic action caused a reduction in particle size \citep{tozzi2014,skovgaard2014} which lowered the slurry yield stress, resulting in higher mean velocities for a given pump flow rate (lower frictional losses). Therefore, the transitions seen at different velocities in the aforementioned studies likely also occurred during wheat straw liquefaction, and may be why three distinct flow behaviors were seen. 
%at later time points, velocities were higher, which meant a more homogeneous flow near the wall when compared to early time points (full plug and annular flow, where the velocity profile was less smooth near the wall). 

In general, fiber suspensions show fiber migration and depletion in the near-wall region \citep{derakhshandeh2011}. In flow studies of microfibrillated cellulose (MFC, mean length: 350 $\mu$m), near-wall measurements with Optical Coherence Tomography showed that a concentration gradient of particles is present under flow conditions \citep{salmela2013}. In these studies, the MFC suspension was Newtonian in behavior near the wall, becoming increasingly non-Newtonian toward the center of the pipe. These observations agree with others' observations of the appearance of a water annulus near the pipe wall. In the case of wheat straw, it is possible that the biphasic, annular flow was due to both a concentration gradient and fiber flocculation. MRI measurements, however, are limited in their ability to resolve the flocs. This may also be why the annular flow behavior was not seen during Solka-Floc liquefaction; at the concentrations studied, the flocs could not be resolved and are thus not apparent with Solka-Floc. Optical techniques like laser Doppler anemometry or optical coherence tomography would confirm near-wall characteristics during the liquefaction of both Solka-Floc and wheat straw. 
%Extensive work has found a relationship between yield stress and mass concentration of fibers in fiber suspensions \citep{lavenson2011,kerekes1985,bennington1990,stickel2009,dalpke2005}. In addition, it is likely that, if a concentration gradient exists, a viscosity (and potentially yield stress) gradient may exist such that two distinct regions appear during annular flow.

%Furthermore, if the flow in the annulus is turbulent as observed with other fiber suspensions, it is likely that velocity fluctuations in the near wall region  

%i think the stuff in the next sentence is backwards
%It is possible that the fibers are distributed within the pipe so that a lower viscosity region flows near the wall, and the higher viscosity region is near the center. 

%Similar flow phenomena is seen in lubricated flow [CITE LUBRICATION FLOW], wherein the two flow regimes allow for reduced energy usage in pumping a highly viscous fluid.  With MRI measurements it is hard to determine whether the biphasic (annular) flow profile during wheat straw lqiuefaction is due to a concentration gradient of particles, or to two dsitinct regions of different bulk proeprties (e.g., two regions of different mean fiber lengths), or a combination of both. It is possible that a concentration gradient (of low concentration enar the wall and high concentration in the center) of particles exists during liquefaction of cellulosic slurries in general, but that the polydispersity of wheat straw particles (versus the more uniform distribution of highly processed Solka-Floc particles) makes a more abrupt dsitnction between flow regimes appear. Despite it being transitional, the appaearance of an annular profile indicates that liquefaction is happening, and may be useful in determining at what stage of liquefaction the slurry is.

%Wall slip is helpful \citep{stickel2009}

%MRI is also an average of a distrribution of velocities at every radial position. Near the wall, the data gets a lot noisier, and it is possible that the inhomogeneties get "averaged out" in the case of cellulose liquefaction.

%Annular flows can indicate the presence of a concentration gradient and velocity heteroegeneities in the viscous region of the pipe

%\citet{fock2011} studied the near-wall characteristics of fiber suspensions, and found that an annular region forms near the wall with inhomogeneous suspension flow. These inhomogeneities did go away at higher velocities, when fibers tended to align with the flow.

Figure \ref{fig:hat_timing} shows the time points during liquefaction when the different types of flow profiles appeared. Each vertical bar spans the total hydrolysis time, with time increasing vertically, and each different color represents a different flow characteristic. The full plug flow (start of hydrolysis, at the bottom) is shown in black, the annular profiles are shown in light gray, and, at later time points, dark gray represents plug flow behavior characteristic of the remainder of hydrolysis. This bar graph is a visual aid in understanding when annular profiles appear and disappear under different hydrolysis conditions. Durations of each flow regime were determined from qualitative assessment of MRI velocity images. For example, in trial ``WS184-CN (45 \degree C),'' full plug flow lasted until approximately 64 minutes, when it transitioned to annular flow, and then transitioned to plug flow again at 94 minutes. It is worth noting that these transitions between flow regimes were not discrete but rather continuous, with most notable changes occurring in the near-wall region. Therefore, the time points between flow regimes shown in Figure \ref{fig:hat_timing} are from when, visually, two consecutive MRI profiles showed distinct flow behaviors.

\begin{figure}[H]

Starting from the bottom (time 0) and moving vertically upwards, black bars show duration of full plug flow, light gray bars show duration of annular flow, and dark gray bars show plug flow over the rest of the course of hydrolysis. Duration of flow regimes was based on qualitative assessment of MRI velocity profiles. Dashed vertical lines are included to aid in data visualization; bars within each region were treated under the same conditions.}
  \label{fig:hat_timing}
\end{figure}

A host of interesting trends arise when looking at flow regimes in this manner, and these trends can be telling about the mechanism of liquefaction under different hydrolysis conditions. Overall, the last trials to reach the final plug flow stage were WS184-CN (45 \degree C) and WS184-TT (45 \degree C), which match the liquefaction trends shown in Figure \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}, where trials run at 45 \degree C liquefied the slowest overall. In contrast, WS195-EG and WS195-TT (both at 55 \degree C) reached the final flow regime the earliest, which agrees with the observation that they liquefied the fastest (Figure \ref{fig:conv_liq}A). Similar enzyme and temperature treatments, in general, liquefied WS195 faster than WS184, as evidenced by that transition to final plug flow happening the earliest in all WS195 trials. Again, this agreed with trends seen in Figure \ref{fig:conv_liq}, where the more severely pretreated substrate (WS195) liquefied the fastest.

The duration and appearance of full plug and annular flows (black and light gray bars, respectively) also followed interesting trends. The duration of annular flow (light gray bars) was in general similar between trials with the same enzyme and temperature conditions, regardless of the substrate. For example, WS184-TT and WS195-TT (both at 45 \degree C) had annular regions that lasted 26.5 minutes on average, even though the annular flow appeared at 39 minutes and 6 minutes for WS184-TT and WS195-TT, respectively. The same trend appears when comparing all ``TT'' and ``EG'' trials (i.e., WS184-TT versus WS195-TT at 55 \degree C, WS184-EG versus WS195-EG). This trend does not appear with Celluclast (CN) trials, however. In the case of TT and EG trials, it would seem that the duration of the annular flow regime was due to the enzymatic treatment used and the process of liquefaction, and was thus independent of how severely the substrate was pretreated. Modeling kinetics on a lignocellulosic, heterogeneous substrate is not trivial, but the consistency of the duration of annular flow may indicate a mechanistic step of liquefaction that is independent of pretreatment results.

A better indicator of efficient liquefaction from this perspective may be how long it took for the substrate to ``leave'' the full plug (initial) flow regime. At the start of hydrolysis, a full plug was present, and the slurry was likely slipping at the wall (see Figure \ref{fig:hat_sample}) \citep{stickel2009}, which could put more stress on the slurry and the enzymes. Spending extended periods of time in this flow regime might irreversibly shear and inactivate liquefying enzymes, and potentially result in higher frictional losses during that process. Trials in which the full plug lasted the longest (WS184-CN at both 45 and 55 \degree C lasting 64 minutes and 60 minutes, respectively) were also the slowest to liquefy overall. The converse is not necessarily true, however. The trial in which the full plug flow lasted the least amount of time (WS195-CN at 55 \degree C, 5 minutes) did not necessarily liquefy the fastest (those trials were WS195-EG and WS195-TT at 55 \degree C). A complex relationship exists between the annular flow appearance and liquefaction efficiency, but investigating physical properties of the slurry during this regime (e.g., particle sizes, volume fractions, in-line radial concentration gradients) might shed light on liquefaction kinetics.



Overall, a complicated relationship exists between these transitional, annular profiles, and what is occurring during liquefaction and enzymatic hydrolysis. Annular flow is an interesting phenomenon that may imply that some sort of lubrication is taking place during the transition from a full plug (with slip at the pipe wall), to a plug flow (with near-zero velocity at the wall). Wall slip can be helpful when pumping concentrated fiber suspensions \citep{stickel2009}. If annular flows are ``lubricated,'' trials in which liquefaction was the fastest (WS195-TT and WS195-EG at 55 \degree C) also had some of the shortest duration of annular flows (7 and 8 minutes, respectively), implying that it might have helped with lubricating the slurry and enabling efficient liquefaction. Further research would be needed to understand if there is a relationship between radial concentration gradients within the pipe and the presence of annular profiles, or if there is any relationship with the particle sizes or crowding behavior occurring during this transition. Qualitatively, it can serve as a good indicator of efficient liquefaction, however, as the earlier it appears, the faster a sample liquefied. Results shown here are mainly of a qualitative nature, but these annular profiles are something worth investigating further to understand the relationship between liquefaction and cellulosic fiber morphological changes (e.g., fiber attrition). 




\subsection{ Effects of temperature on wheat straw hydrolysis }\label{section:temp}
Batch hydrolysis experiments were done on both WS184 and WS195 at two different temperatures (45 \degree C and 55 \degree C) with the full enzyme mixtures (TT and CN). \textit{Trichoderma reesei} cellulases (Celluclast) hydrolyze optimally at approximately 50 \degree C \citep{castellanos1995} and thermostable cellulases (Thermomix) maintain their activity at 55 \degree C \citep{bhalla2013,turner2007}, so it was expected that a loss in liquefaction rates or extents of saccharification would be present at 45 \degree C, a temperature lower than the optimum. Figure \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp} shows liquefaction and saccharification results under these conditions; \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}A and \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}B show WS184 results, and \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}C and \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}D show WS195 results. 

\begin{figure}[H]

B and D show conversion versus viscosity to highlight potential mass transfer differences between trials. Similar symbols across figures indicate similar enzyme and temperature treatments.}
  \label{fig:conv_xfer_temp}
\end{figure}

In the case of WS184 (Figure \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}A and B), TT at 55 \degree C liquefied the fastest and CN at 45 \degree C the slowest, but all reached liquefaction steady state by 2.5 hours of hydrolysis (150 minutes). TT at 55 \degree C also achieved the highest levels of conversion (39.3\%), whereas all other trials hydrolyzed to a similar extent (33.6 $\pm$ 0.7\%). WS195 showed less distinction between trials with respect to rates of liquefaction. Enzymes at 55 \degree C liquefied the fastest (triangles and squares in Figure \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}C), but all were done liquefying  at around 100 minutes of hydrolysis.   With respect to conversion, both 55 \degree C trials hydrolyzed to a similar extent (25.9\%), whereas both 45 \degree C trials hydrolyzed the least out of all trials (including WS184), with the lowest conversion with CN at 45 \degree C on WS195 (19.2 \% of theoretical, circles in Figure \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}C). Due to enzyme temperature optima, it follows that all trials liquefied and hydrolyzed better at 55 \degree C than 45 \degree C for both substrates. Although differences were not significant, it is important to maintain isothermal conditions at the enzymes' optimum during hydrolysis to ensure highest productivity.

Figures \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}B and \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}D show conversion versus viscosity over the course of hydrolysis (i.e., same data as in Figures \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}A and \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}C, respectively) to try to understand if there were any mass transfer limitations that inhibited sugar release due to viscosity differences under different hydrolysis conditions. WS184 and WS195 responded differently to changes in temperature. With WS184 (Figure \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}B), more differences in conversion at a given viscosity appeared at higher viscosity values (approximately 0.7-1 Pa$\cdot$s), i.e., early in hydrolysis. Both trials at 55 \degree C showed lower viscosities at around 0\% conversion, which follows from the fact that those trials also liquefied faster. Viscosity is also generally inversely dependent on temperature, and therefore it makes sense that at a given degree of conversion, the 55 \degree C trials were less viscous  than the 45 \degree C trials. In addition, since conversions were all similar during the first hour of hydrolysis (Figure \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}A), it makes sense that 55 \degree C trials were less viscous for a given conversion value because they were liquefied more efficiently. At lower viscosities (<0.1 Pa$\cdot$s), which was later in hydrolysis, not much change in viscosity was seen anymore as glucan conversion continued to increase. In all cases (Figure \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}B, D) there seems to be a linear relationship between glucan conversion and viscosity (see Appendix \ref{app:wheat_straw} for additional modeling details). WS195 trials liquefied faster than WS184 trials, and a stronger decoupling of conversion and liquefaction was seen; there seems to be a discrete separation between points around 1 Pa$\cdot$s and below 0.4 Pa$\cdot$s, as liquefaction happened so fast (within 30 minutes), that viscosity values changed dramatically early on while little conversion occurred.
%As expected, the 55 \degree C trials are the two lowest sets of points in Figure \ref{fig:conv_xfer_temp}B, as at any extent of hydrolysis, they were the least viscous due to their more efficient liquefaction. Furthermore, 

\subsection{Effects of fiber hydration on subsequent hydrolysis}\label{section:swell}
Without enzymes added, wheat straw absorbed water when in suspension, which changed its bulk rheological properties. Figure \ref{fig:blank_swell} shows what the in-line pressure drop in the flow loop was for wheat straw without enzymes added (blank trial). The pressure drop increased around three-fold for both substrates over 5 hours of hydration. Despite increases in pressure drops, hydration did not affect the mean fiber length of the fibers (data not shown). The pressure increase was likely due to fibers absorbing the water in the bulk,  making the slurry as a whole appear more viscous. 

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3in]{wheat-rheology/blank_swell}
  \caption[Wheat straw hydration under flow conditions.]{Wheat straw hydration under flow conditions when no enzyme was added. The in-line pressure drop of both WS184 (black) and WS195 (white) increased over 5 hours of flow at 6\% solids.}
  \label{fig:blank_swell}
\end{figure}

Despite the in-line pressure increase, water being absorbed might help with mass transport since more water is potentially present in the pores of the fibers, facilitating diffusion of cellulases and reaction products. This hypothesis was tested by pre-hydrating a batch of wheat straw prior to hydrolysis and comparing hydrolysis results with that of a batch that was not soaked in buffer overnight. If a difference is seen, it would have scale-up implications if biomass is held in a tank prior to hydrolysis. In one of the experimental conditions (WS184-CN, 45 \degree C), an experiment to compare hydrolysis performance with and without fiber pre-hydration was done. Both these trials had the same amount of solids, buffer, and enzyme added, with the only difference being the amount of time the wheat straw soaked in the buffer prior to enzyme addition (overnight versus 5 minutes). Figure \ref{fig:conv_xfer_swell} shows the results of these experiments.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5.5in]{wheat-rheology/conv_xfer_swell}
  \caption[Effect of pre-hydration on liquefaction and saccharification of wheat straw.]{Effect of pre-hydration on liquefaction and saccharification of wheat straw.

B) Conversion versus viscosity of both trials to highlight potential mass transfer differences due to fiber hydration.}
  \label{fig:conv_xfer_swell}
\end{figure}

As expected, the pre-hydrated fibers started at a higher viscosity (circles in Figure \ref{fig:conv_xfer_swell}A), yet they achieved liquefaction at the same rate, and with no significant difference in overall conversion when compared to unsoaked samples. Similarly, a conversion versus viscosity plot (Figure \ref{fig:conv_xfer_swell}B) shows no significant differences except at low conversions, when the pre-hydrated fibers (white circles in Figure \ref{fig:conv_xfer_swell}B) were more viscous than the unsoaked ones (black squares in Figure \ref{fig:conv_xfer_swell}B) at a given conversion value. Fits of conversion versus viscosity showed no significant difference between trials (see Appendix \ref{app:wheat_straw} for additional fitting details). Therefore, it is unlikely that water absorption improved mass transport within the fiber pores. When in a cellulosic suspension, water is present in different ``pools'' --- locations relative to the solid interface --- that interact differently with the cellulosic substrate, especially during hydrolysis \citep{roberts2011,felby2008}.  \citet{selig2013} hypothesized that the most constrained pool of water has the most direct correlation with extent of hydrolysis; although water was absorbed during hydration of wheat straw, it is possible that the water population that is changing is not the one that most directly impacts hydrolysis outcomes. In an industrial process, pre-hydrating fibers will most likely not have an effect on hydrolysis outcomes, but it will affect the initial slurry viscosity, which can affect initial pumping and mixing. It is therefore important to not hydrate fibers for extended periods of time so as to not incur more energy usage costs of pumping a higher viscosity slurry. 


%Going back to Figure \ref{fig:hat_timing}, pre-hydration did not seem to make much of a difference in the duration of full plug flow (black bars). Annular profiles lasted a little less in the pre-hydrated sample, indicating a slight improvement in liquefaction as it transitioned onto the next flow regime earlier than the unsoaked case. Pre-hydration might in fact improve mass transfer due to the water absoprtion, which might make endoglucanases liquefy more efficiently when the wheat straw was pre-hydrated. This improvement in mass transport was not evident from the duration of full plug flow, however, and these improvements go away by the end of hydrolysis, as no liquefaction differences were evident. This seeming improvement in amss transport was not evident form sugar release, and only impacted liquefaction.

\section{Conclusion}
Steam pretreated wheat straw was hydrolyzed under various enzyme and hydrolysis conditions in a recycle-flow reactor to understand the rheological changes it undergoes during hydrolysis. Liquefaction and saccharification were decoupled in trials with enzyme mixtures. Furthermore, a transitional annular flow profile appeared during liquefaction of wheat straw. Annular flows can indicate the presence of a concentration gradient and velocity heterogeneities in the viscous region of the pipe due to fiber flocculation; further investigation into this phenomena could lead to an understanding of physical changes in the substrate during liquefaction. In addition, trials at different temperatures highlighted the importance of operating at enzyme optima. The effects of fiber hydration prior to hydrolysis were also tested; pre-soaking fibers does not impact hydrolysis yields, but can incur high viscosities at the start of hydrolysis that make the slurry more difficult to handle. Overall, these studies on lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysis under different conditions, with an emphasis on liquefaction characterization, have an impact on process modeling and scale-up considerations.

\section{Abstract}
The role of endocellulases and endoxylanase during liquefaction and saccharification of hydrothermally pretreated wheat straw was studied. The use of a flow-loop setup with in-line magnetic resonance imaging enabled frequent measurements of viscosity at 55\degree{C} during saccharification at 6\% total solids content. Viscosity data were complemented with off-line measurements of fiber lengths and release of soluble sugars. A clear correlation between fiber attrition and a decrease in viscosity was found. Fiber lengths and viscosity dropped quickly within the first hour and then stagnated, while sugar yields increased substantially thereafter, illustrating that liquefaction and saccharification are separate mechanisms. Both endoglucanase and endoxylanase were shown to have a significant effect on viscosity during liquefaction while the addition of endoxylanase also increased sugar yield.

\section{Introduction}
Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising source for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals. However, the conversion process from biomass to bioethanol needs to be optimized further to reduce processing costs, for example, by running the process at high solids contents \citep{qi2011,larsen2012}. The consequence of working at high dry matter is that nearly no free water exists in the biomass mixture, which exacerbates the difficulties of mixing in conventional bioreactors \citep{kristensen2009}. Liquefaction occurs during the initial phase of saccharification where enzymes partially degrade the biomass structure. Thereby they reduce fiber length, fiber-fiber interactions, and water holding capacity, which results in a biomass suspension that can be easily mixed and pumped \citep{szijarto2011b,thygesen2011}.

The rheological behavior of lignocellulosic material, especially during the early stage of enzymatic hydrolysis, is affected by the physical properties of the biomass, the enzymes applied, and the conditions under which the hydrolysis is conducted. During pretreatment, the cell walls of fibers and other cells in the biomass can become partially disrupted. This results in a branched and frayed structure, which leads to more entanglement among fibers resulting in a higher viscosity \citep{kristensen2008,caprita2011,viamajala2009}. When fibers are mixed with water, they will absorb water, which can cause swelling and hence an increase in suspension viscosity until the fibers reach their saturation point. During hydrolysis, fibers are cut into segments and water hereby released, which reduces viscosity \citep{thygesen2011,lapierre2009}.

To perform efficient liquefaction, high temperatures are advantageous as they can reduce the viscosity of the biomass slurry \citep{haki2003}. However, hydrolysis at higher temperatures requires enzymes capable of functioning in such conditions. Thermostable enzymes, which are active at temperatures above 55\degree{C}, are known to be more stable and have a higher specific activity \citep{turner2007,viikari2007}. Enzyme mixtures are commercially available and are comprised primarily of the cellulases responsible for cellulose hydrolysis: endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and $\beta$-glucosidases. Endoglucanases are in particular of interest in liquefaction, as they play a role in cleaving cellulose chains resulting in a reduction in degree of polymerization \citep{thygesen2011,szijarto2011}. Xylanases are also important, as cellulose fibrils in lignocellulosic biomass are known to be closely associated with and, to some extent, covered by xylan, which limits the access of cellulases to the cellulose fibrils \citep{park2012,arantes2010}. By addition of xylanases, performance of cellulases has shown to be improved, possibly due to relocation and degradation of xylan closely associated with cellulose \citep{zhang2011}.

Monitoring viscosity in biomass during liquefaction can be advantageous at the industrial scale as rheological properties affect power consumption and equipment requirements \citep{wiman2011}. To monitor biomass rheology during hydrolysis, it is important that these measurements be made \textit{in situ}, fast, and noninvasively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has previously been used to measure the yield stress and apparent viscosities of non-Newtonian fluids (e.g., biomass mixtures) reliably and consistently via imaging of spatially resolved velocity profiles \citep{lavenson2012b}. During MRI, the relaxation of hydrogen nuclei (i.e., protons) and their motion in bulk are measured. From these measurements, mean velocity profiles in a pipe can be obtained, which in this case provide rheological information of the pretreated biomass during hydrolysis.

The aim of this study was to understand the role of endoglucanase and endoxylanase and the factors affecting liquefaction during the early stage of biomass saccharification. Hydrothermally pretreated wheat straw was reacted with monocomponents or defined mixtures of thermostable cellulases and xylanase. An in-line MRI flow loop was used for continuous measurement of viscosity and samples were frequently taken for off-line measurement of fiber lengths and sugar release.

\section{ Materials and Methods }
\subsection{ Biomass }
Hydrothermal pretreatment of Danish wheat straw (\textit{Triticum aestivum} L.) was performed at Inbicon, Sk{\ae}rb{\ae}k, Denmark. The straw was pretreated for 12 min at 18\degree{C} (henceforth referred to as WS in the text). The water-straw ratio was 5:1.19 After pretreatment, the fibers were pressed to a final dry matter content of 36 \% and stored at 22\degree{C}. The solid fiber fraction was analyzed using the procedure described by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory \citep{sluiter2010}. The composition of WS at the start of hydrolysis was 47.9\% glucan, 10.8\% xylan, 29.5\% lignin, and 5.1\% ash.

\subsection{ Enzymes }
Two thermostable enzyme preparations denoted Mix1 and Mix2 were tested. Mix1 contained 13\% endoglucanase II (EG) (Cel5A), 14\% endoxylanase (XYL) (XYN11), and 5\% $\beta$-glucosidase (Cel3A) from \textit{Thermoascus aurantiacus}, 51\% cellobiohydrolase I (Cel7A) from \textit{Acremonium thermophillum}, and 17\% cellobiohydrolase II (Cel6A) from Chaetomium thermophillum. The specific enzymes were purified before they were mixed on a protein content basis (mg enzyme protein [EP]/mg total enzyme mixture). Mix2 contained the same enzyme concentrations as Mix1 except that XYL was left out. Mix2 was heat-treated to inactivate endoxylanase background activity. Additional experiments were conducted using purified EG and XYL. The composition of the enzyme mixtures (mg EP of each component) and total EP dosage used in the experiments are shown in Table \ref{table:enzymes}.

\subsection{Protein content and enzyme activity}
The protein contents of the enzyme mixtures were measured using the ninhydrin assay described by \citet{skovgaard2013} Filter paper activity and endoglucanase activity were measured as described by \citet{ghose1987} while endoxylanase activity was measured following \citet{bailey1992}.

\subsection{Magnetic resonance imaging for rheological measurements}
Non-invasive \textit{in situ} rheological measurements during hydrolysis were performed using a Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) sequence in an MRI system consisting of an Aspect Imaging 1.03 T permanent magnet with 0.3 T/m peak gradient strength (Aspect Imaging, Hevel Modi’in Industrial Area, Shoham, Israel). The radio frequency coil was a solenoid with three turns enclosing a cylindrical volume 38 mm in diameter and 36 mm long. An in-line MRI flow loop as demonstrated by \citet{lavenson2011}, with the addition of a five-turn heat exchanger coil submerged in a 23 L thermostatic water bath (PolyScience 9610, Niles, IL) was used during the experiments to obtain velocity profiles (as a function of radial position) of the flowing biomass slurries. Figure \ref{fig:MRIsample} details how velocity profiles obtained via MRI were used to measure rheological data. Shear rates ($\gamma$) were obtained by differentiation of the velocity profiles (Figure \ref{fig:MRIsample}B), and shear stresses ($\tau$) were calculated as a function of radial position using $\tau (r) = (\Delta P \cdot r)/(2L)$, wherein $\Delta P/L$ is the pressure drop per unit length of pipe (Figure \ref{fig:MRIsample}D). Viscosities were obtained as a function of shear rates (Figure \ref{fig:MRIsample}C) from the shear stress vs. shear rate data (Figure \ref{fig:MRIsample}D). Apparent viscosities, when reported, correspond to viscosities obtained at a shear rate of 10 s$^{-1}$ from results similar to those shown in Figure \ref{fig:MRIsample}C. To ensure sufficient homogenization of biomass slurries during rheological measurements, viscosities were computed from images obtained after approximately 10 min of hydrolysis.

A velocity profile (A) was obtained with a PGSE sequence, and the velocity data were extracted from the image (B) depending on signal intensity in (A). The velocity data, in conjunction with the measured pressure drop in the pipe, were used to obtain rheological information about the flowing slurry (C, viscosity vs. shear rates, and D, shear stress vs. shear rates). More specifically, velocity profiles were differentiated to obtain figure (D). Viscosity results in subsequent figures were thus extracted from data similar to (C).}

\subsection{Enzymatic hydrolysis in the in-line MRI flow loop}
Sodium citrate buffer (50 mM) at pH 4.9 was preheated to 60\degree{C} by pumping it in the in-line MRI flow loop, at which point pretreated WS was added to reach 6\% (w/w) dry matter (DM) content. The continuously flowing mixture was mixed in the recycle tank with an impeller mixer. The biomass and buffer mixture was then allowed to reach 55\degree{C} (reaction temperature) and a pressure drop in the pipe ($\Delta P$) of 4,000 $\pm$ 10 Pa. WS appeared to absorb water upon addition to the buffer, which led to a gradual increase in the inline pressure (data not shown). The mixture was thus allowed to reach the same pressure drop prior to hydrolysis to ensure it was always started at similar viscosities. Enzyme was then slowly added to the biomass mixture at dosages shown in Table \ref{table:enzymes}. The total reactor mass for hydrolysis (WS, buffer, and enzyme) was 12 kg, which was continuously circulated in the MRI flow loop during the 5 h of hydrolysis. Samples were periodically taken in 15 mL centrifuge tubes from the tank in the flow loop during the 5 h run. The sample centrifuge tubes were then boiled in water for 10 min to stop the enzymatic reaction, and stored in a -22\degree{C} freezer until further analysis. The experiments were only repeated once, as earlier studies with the same setup have shown good reproducibility \citep{lavenson2012b}. As a test for reproducibility, a control experiment with Mix1 was run twice at 45 \degree{C}, and the average glucan conversion of WS after 1 and 5 h hydrolysis was 9.7 $\pm$ 0.2 and 23.3 $\pm$ 0.5, respectively, and apparent viscosity in Pa$\cdot$s at shear rate 10 s$^{-1}$ after 1 and 5 h was 0.143 $\pm$ 0.008 and 0.060 $\pm$ 0.002, respectively. Little variability among trials (standard deviations of all results were all within 5\% of means) gives confidence in the reproducibility of the setup used. An additional control experiment was run in which WS was circulated through the setup for up to 5 h with no enzyme added to test for the presence of any mechanical effects of the equipment used (e.g., pump and impeller mixer) on the fibers. The fiber length distribution and total fiber length of WS remained unchanged (data not shown), indicating that any observed changes in fiber properties are attributable to enzymatic action.

\subsection{High Performance Liquid Chromatography}
Concentration of soluble sugars was analyzed by a Dionex Summit HPLC equipped with a Shimadzu RI-detector. Separation was performed in a Phenomenex Rezex ROA column at 80 \degree{C} with 5 mM \ce{H2SO4} as eluent at flow rate 0.6 mL/min. Calibration was performed with standard solutions of \textsc{D}-glucose, \textsc{L}-arabinose, \textsc{D}-xylose, \textsc{D}-mannose, \textsc{D}-galactose, and \textsc{D}-cellobiose. Glucan and xylan conversion were calculated based on the measured concentrations of glucose, cellobiose, and xylose using equations from \citet{kristensen2009b}.

\subsection{Fiber length analysis}
The FiberTester automatic image analysis of fiber dimensions in suspension was performed by Innventia (Stockholm, Sweden, www.innventia.se). The L{\&}W FiberTester (Lorentzen and Wettre, Kista, Sweden) measures dimensions of particles consisting of one or more plant cells, which in this article is referred to as fibers. Fiber lengths refer to the longest dimension of solid particles. These may be (a segment of) an individual cell, or a few cells attached to each other. Around 80,000 fibers with a length between 15 $\mu$m and 7 mm were successfully measured per sample. A description of the procedure is found in \citet{thygesen2011}.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Enzyme activity and protein content}
Protein content and enzyme activity were measured for the different enzyme preparations (Table \ref{table:enz_activity}). Activity is reported per mg EP as enzyme was dosed based on mg EP/g DM. Specific endoglucanase, xylanase, and filter paper activities were lower in Mix2 compared to Mix1. This was most likely due to the heat treatment of Mix2, which was intended to minimize background xylanase activity. As a consequence of this difference between Mix1 and Mix2, results obtained with the two mixtures cannot be directly compared. Xylanase activity was found in the purified EG preparation, likely attributable to contamination with xylanase, as confirmed by SDS-PAGE revealing a faint band with molecular weight corresponding to a xylanase (data not shown). The only activity found for XYL was xylanase activity.

\subsection{The role of endoglucanase in liquefaction}
The role of endoglucanase activity on liquefaction was studied by comparing saccharification of WS with 10 mg EP/g DM of Mix1 and EG (see Table \ref{table:enzymes}). Changes in viscosity, fiber length, and sugar conversion are shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig2}. Within the first 60 min of hydrolysis, WS was more rapidly liquefied by EG than by Mix1 as evidenced by the faster drop in viscosity (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}A). After 90 min, the viscosity reached a steady value around 0.090 6 0.005 Pa$\cdot$s with EG while the viscosity using Mix1 continued to decrease to 0.050 $\pm$ 0.005 Pa$\cdot$s at 5 h. That an endoglucanase alone was more effective than a full cellulase mixture in decreasing the viscosity during the initial hours of hydrolysis is not surprising, as this has been previously reported\citep{szijarto2011b}. Furthermore, both enzyme treatments had the same total concentration of enzyme protein added, meaning that there was more endoglucanase present in the purified EG (10.0 mg EP/g DM) than in Mix1 (1.3 mg EP/g DM). It is probable that the excess EG may have caused the improvement in rates of liquefaction during the first 60 min. Thereafter, however, viscosity continued to decrease with Mix1 even though it had a reduced concentration of EG. It is thus important to have a more complete mixture of cellulases for effective hydrolysis in longer reactions, while endoglucanase would be the optimal cellulase for liquefaction if the primary goal was to reduce viscosity quickly.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3in]{egxyl/fig2}
  \caption[Liquefaction of WS at 6\% DM, 55\degree{C} with Mix1 and EG, both at 10 mg EP/g DM.]{Liquefaction of WS at 6\% DM, 55\degree{C} with Mix1 (circles) and EG (triangles), both at 10 mg EP/g DM.

Both viscosity and fiber length show an initial fast reduction, followed by a slowdown in observable changes, whereas both glucan and xylan conversion continue to increase.}
  \label{fig:fig2}
\end{figure}

The fiber length data in Figure \ref{fig:fig2}B showed a similar trend where EG caused a slightly more rapid decrease in mean fiber length within the first 90 min, but beyond this time point there was a slowdown in the rate of fiber length reduction for both treatments. In addition, Mix1 yielded shorter fibers by the end of the 5 h of hydrolysis compared to EG (in average 132 mm and 167 mm for Mix1 and EG, respectively). EG appears to be more effective at reducing the average fiber length, but it seems that after viscosity has been reduced by a certain extent, other cellulases may also contribute to fiber length reduction.

As would be expected, the glucan conversion was clearly higher and more rapid with Mix1 than EG (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}C, filled-in symbols). After 90 min, the liquefaction appears to be complete since little change in viscosity is observed. However, only a minor change in glucan conversion using EG was observed, while glucan conversion by Mix1 continued to increase. This is expected, as Mix1 contains exocellulases that release glucose and cellobiose, which are the sugars used for calculation of glucan conversion. EG would most likely release polysaccharides and oligosaccharides that are not accounted for in this measure of conversion. The rate and extent of xylan conversion (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}C, empty symbols) was higher for Mix1 than EG, which correlates well with the xylanase activity measured, where Mix1 had a higher xylanase activity than EG (Table \ref{table:enz_activity}).

It is important to note that after the first couple of hours of hydrolysis, both enzyme treatments appear to have similar effects on viscosity and fiber length reduction, with Mix1 appearing to be slightly better at changing these physical properties. This is indicative that after reducing the viscosity of the biomass slurry by a certain extent, the other cellulases may also contribute to viscosity and length reduction as well as sugar release. From an application perspective, the rapid liquefaction using high loadings of endoglucanase is advantageous, as this improves pumpability and mixability of the biomass at a faster rate, reducing energy usage in those processes. However, the slow release of glucose (7.2\% glucan conversion for EG after 5 h compared to 28\% for Mix1) is not desirable. Although endoglucanase alone may be highly effective as a liquefying enzyme, it is important that a mixture of cellulases is present for effective hydrolysis.

\subsection{The role of endoxylanase in liquefaction}
As WS contained 10.8\% xylan, which can sterically hinder cellulases from accessing cellulose \citep{park2012}, the potential for synergy between an endoglucanase and an endoxylanase was tested. Although the EG preparation had a low background xylanase activity (17 nkat/mg EP), the impact of further addition of XYL was tested (activities shown in Table \ref{table:enz_activity}). EG and XYL were dosed based on the EP loading in Mix1 (Table \ref{table:enzymes}) to better understand the impact of these monocomponents on liquefaction. This means that the xylanase loadings were 22 nkat/g DM for EG and 5,656 nkat/g DM for EG+XYL. The changes in viscosity and sugar release are shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig3}.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3in]{egxyl/fig3}
  \caption[Liquefaction of WS at 6\% DM, 55 \degree{C} with EG (1.3 mg EP/g DM) and EG+XYL (1.3 + 1.4 mg EP/g DM).] {Liquefaction of WS at 6\% DM, 55 \degree{C} with EG (1.3 mg EP/g DM) (circles) and EG+XYL (1.311.4 mg EP/g DM) (triangles). (A) Apparent viscosities (Pa$\cdot$s) at a shear rate of 10 s$^{-1}$, and (B) glucan conversion (closed symbols) and xylan conversion (open symbols). Viscosity shows an initial fast reduction followed by a slowdown in observable changes.}
  \label{fig:fig3}
\end{figure}

Viscosity was generally lower when using EG+XYL (triangles in Figure \ref{fig:fig3}A) compared to using EG only (circles in Figure \ref{fig:fig3}A), but the differences were minor. The glucan conversion was also only marginally higher when XYL was added (filled-in triangles in Figure \ref{fig:fig3}B). However, the xylan conversion (empty triangles for EG+XYL, empty circles for EG only) was clearly improved when EG was supplemented with XYL as substantially more xylose was released. This is expected as the xylanase activity increases over two hundred-fold when going from EG to EG+XYL. Overall, although more xylan was released with the addition of XYL, little differences were seen in the changes in apparent viscosity and on glucose release. This indicates that the presence of xylan did not hinder liquefaction of WS.

One possible reason for the observed small effect of additional XYL on the action of EG could be that the background xylanase activity in the EG preparation was sufficient to counteract the hindering effects of the xylan content in WS. Another reason could be that the xylan content in the pretreated WS was not significant enough to reduce the accessibility of cellulose, as glucan conversion was the same for both EG and EG+XYL (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}B). In both cases, there was appropriate xylan breakdown with EG alone, that is, further hydrolysis was not particularly beneficial for saccharification or liquefaction.

Although the effect of additional xylanase activity was negligible in relation to the function of endoglucanases, the positive effect of supplementing with xylanases has been reported for complete cellulase mixtures \citep{arantes2010}. Therefore, the impact of adding XYL to Mix2 (a cellulase mixture with low xylanase activity) was assessed (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}).

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3in]{egxyl/fig4}
  \caption[Liquefaction of WS at 6\% DM, 55 \degree{C} with Mix2 and Mix2+XYL.]{Liquefaction of WS at 6\% DM, 55 \degree{C} with Mix2 (8.6 mg EP/g DM) (circles) and Mix2+XYL (10.0 mg EP/g DM) (triangles). (A) Apparent viscosities (Pa$\cdot$s) at a shear rate of 10 s$^{-1}$, and (B) corresponding length-weighted mean fiber lengths, and (C) glucan conversion (closed symbols) and xylan conversion (open symbols). Both enzyme treatments exhibit similar rates of liquefaction (A) and fiber shortening (B), but addition of XYL resulted in lower overall viscosities and fiber lengths. XYL addition resulted in increased glucan and xylan conversion (C).}
  \label{fig:fig4}
\end{figure}

The addition of XYL to Mix2 clearly had an effect on liquefaction of WS (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}A) as well as glucan and xylan conversion (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}C). Viscosity after 30 min of hydrolysis by Mix2+XYL was half that of Mix2 only (0.39 Pa$\cdot$s vs. 0.79 Pa$\cdot$s for Mix2+XYL and Mix2, respectively) (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}A). In addition, the final value of viscosity after 5 h of liquefaction was also lower for Mix2+XYL (triangles in Figure \ref{fig:fig4}A). The changes in mean fiber lengths (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}B) of the two mixtures also appeared to correlate well with viscosity changes. WS hydrolyzed with Mix2+XYL generally had a mean fiber length which was 4-17\% shorter (i.e., 20-50 mm) (triangles in Figure \ref{fig:fig4}B) compared to WS hydrolyzed with Mix2 only (circles in Figure \ref{fig:fig4}B). Addition of xylanase thus seemed to improve the extent of liquefaction and contribute to a final product with slightly shorter fibers. However, it is worth noting that despite differences in the magnitude of viscosity, both enzyme treatments appear to slow down in liquefaction at around the same time (70 min), as they both reach an apparent steady value of viscosity. Similarities in rates are also apparent when comparing changes in fiber lengths. Even though Mix2+XYL had shorter mean fiber length, after 50 min, both treatments appeared to change fiber sizes at approximately the same rate (both curves are nearly parallel after 50 min). Similar rates of liquefaction (in the form of similar rates of viscosity reduction and fiber shortening), both with and without XYL added, are not surprising in light of the results shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig3} (EG vs. EG+XYL). Figure \ref{fig:fig3} showed that adding XYL did not significantly improve liquefaction of this substrate, while Figures \ref{fig:fig4}A, B show that after an initial improvement in rates of liquefaction with the addition of XYL, not much difference is seen in any of the treatments. This may hint at the synergy between XYL and the cellulases in Mix2, which leads to overall shorter fibers and a less viscous slurry. It is possible that XYL helps hydrolyzing hemicellulose, which leads to a less viscous substrate. After the initial activity, the effects of EG become more prominent in liquefaction, and as Mix2 and Mix2+XYL have the same protein concentration of EG (Table \ref{table:enzymes}), rates of liquefaction are practically the
same.

In Figure \ref{fig:fig4}C, the effects of addition of XYL on sugar release are shown, where addition of XYL not only had a positive effect on xylan conversion but also on glucan conversion. With Mix2+XYL, glucan conversion was nearly 10\% and xylan conversion 17\% after 5 h, whereas it with Mix2 only was 6\% glucan and 6\% xylan conversion. The low conversion obtained with Mix2 compared to levels measured with Mix1 (see Figure \ref{fig:fig2}C) was due to the heat treatment of Mix2. As expected, adding XYL had the biggest impact on xylan conversion, as nearly no conversion of xylan was seen when XYL was not present (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}C,empty circles). The positive effect of xylanase has also been observed in other studies using corn stover, bleached softwood chemical pulp, and nanofibrillated cellulose, where conversion was increased by addition of xylanase \citep{ohgren2007,varnai2011}. The improvement, which XYL had on glucan conversion, can be attributed to its synergy with the other cellulases, as its action on the hemicellulose component of WS can improve accessibility of other cellulases to cellulose. To improve the rate of liquefaction of pretreated biomass, it therefore seemed beneficial to add xylanase to the process.

\subsection{The relationship between viscosity and mean fiber length}
During liquefaction of WS, lower viscosities were associated with lower mean fiber lengths as expected from the literature \citep{lapierre2009}. Correlating changes in fiber length with changes in viscosity (Figure \ref{fig:fig5}) suggests a relationship between these two physical characteristics that is highly dependent on enzyme treatment.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \label{fig:fig5}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:fig5}A shows data for Mix1 vs. EG experiments (also shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig2}), and Figure \ref{fig:fig5}B shows the results of Mix2 vs. Mix2+XYL experiments (also shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig4}). As these experiments are showcasing different enzyme mechanisms, they are presented in different log–log plots.

Comparing EG (open circles) and Mix1 (filled-in circles) in Figure \ref{fig:fig5}A, it was indicated that using EG alone resulted in a lower viscosity than for Mix1 at the same mean fiber length, especially at earlier hydrolysis times (top right, Figure \ref{fig:fig5}A). For example, the viscosity at a mean fiber length of 250 mm was 0.21 Pa$\cdot$s for Mix1 and 0.14 Pa$\cdot$s for EG. The total enzyme dosage of EG and Mix1 was the same (10 mg EP/g DM) during liquefaction, but the cellulase and xylanase activities differed (Table \ref{table:enz_activity}). Xylan conversion was close to equal for the two enzyme mixtures (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}B) indicating equal release of xylose. Therefore, components other than xylan in the substrate and the effects of enzyme action on the substrate would likely be the cause for the differences observed. Research has indicated that addition of endoglucanases to cellulose loosens the bound water associated with the fibrils \citep{felby2008}. Using a monocomponent endoglucanase at a higher dosage would perhaps release more bound water to the mixture, which reduces viscosity. In addition, studies have shown that endoglucanases seem to defibrillate fibers by cleaving off protruding fibrils. This leaves behind smoother fibers that presumably would be easier to mix, which could contribute to a lowering in viscosity \citep{garcia2013,stork1995}. Therefore, an excess of endoglucanase could result in a biomass slurry that is on average less viscous with fibers of similar length. An additional factor contributing to these differences in viscosity at similar fiber lengths could be that a complete suite of enzyme activities (as in Mix1) gives a more efficient cell-wall breakdown, presumably resulting in the release and exposure of soluble glucan oligomers, which could increase viscosity and/or increase fiber–fiber interactions to the same effect.

In Figure \ref{fig:fig5}B, Mix2 (filled-in triangles) and Mix2+XYL (empty triangles) are compared (data also shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig4}). The reaction mixture with Mix2 had higher viscosity than Mix2+XYL at the same mean fiber lengths (Figure \ref{fig:fig5}B). Again, the enzyme treatment that seemed to result in faster liquefaction and lower final viscosity had lower viscosities at the same fiber lengths. For viscosities to be lower at a given fiber length, more free water should be available in the mixture. More xylan was converted when WS was reacted with Mix2+XYL compared to Mix2 only (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}C). Based on work by \citet{selig2012}, one can speculate that water molecules are more constrained by xylan than by cellulose, and thus a reduction in xylan content would reduce the amount of bound water, reducing the overall viscosity. Another reason for the differences could be that Mix2+XYL contained more EP (10 mg EP/g DM) compared to Mix2 only (8.6 mg EP/g DM) and that Mix2+XYL contained more endo-acting enzyme as XYL mainly acted as an endoxylanase.

In both cases, there was a clear downward trend of viscosity with shorter fiber lengths, and the enzyme mixtures that resulted in faster liquefaction yielded lower viscosities at a given particle size. However, when comparing EG and Mix1, the differences seemed more readily attributable to the excess in endoglucanase, while for Mix2 vs. Mix2+XYL the differences seemed to arise due to differences in xylan digestion. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind the enzyme mechanisms at play when drawing conclusions.

Furthermore, other physical characteristics of fiber suspensions (e.g., concentration, volume fraction, and fiber aspect ratio) have been shown to affect fiber-fiber interactions and viscosity \citep{tozzi2013}. Attempting to find an empirical relationship between fiber length and viscosity alone would greatly simplify the effects of fiber morphology on biomass rheology. However, more research is required to understand the relation between particle size, biomass, and enzymes.

\subsection{The relationship between viscosity and saccharification}
As observed in this and other studies using pretreated wheat straw or Solka Floc (a delignified cellulose), most of the reduction in viscosity occurs in the beginning of liquefaction \citep{szijarto2011b,lavenson2012b}. However, a quick liquefaction in the first hours of hydrolysis and lower final viscosities after 5 h did not consistently result in a higher glucan yield, which suggests separate mechanisms for liquefaction and soluble sugar release. Additionally, by the time viscosities reached a relatively steady final value, only a fraction of the final glucan conversion had taken place. This indicates that they are separate processes using the mechanisms of enzyme action differently. The process of liquefaction was mainly due to endoglucanase activity, while sugar release was mainly due to cellobiohydrolase activity.

Even though extensive liquefaction did not directly correlate with extensive saccharification, it is probable that the reduction in viscosity can improve sugar release if exocellulases are present, which indicates synergy between these two processes. To better understand this, Figure \ref{fig:fig6} presents normalized viscosity (viscosity divided by the maximum initial viscosity for that trial) vs. glucan conversion for Mix1 and EG (also shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig2}).

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3in]{egxyl/fig6}
  \caption[Glucan conversion (\% of theoretical max) vs. viscosity at a shear rate of 10 s$^{-1}$ for WS at 6\% DM, 55 \degree{C} and 10 mg EP/g-DM treated with Mix1 and EG.]{Glucan conversion (\% of theoretical max) vs. viscosity at a shear rate of 10 s$^{-1}$ for WS at 6\% DM, 55 \degree{C} and 10 mg EP/g-DM treated with Mix1 (filled-in circles) and EG (empty circles). No linear correlation was observed.}
  \label{fig:fig6}
\end{figure}

For Mix1, it was observed that at high viscosities (>50\% of maximum viscosity) low glucan conversions were measured, but these were highly improved when viscosities were reduced to <20\% of their starting values. In other words, liquefaction seemed to enhance sugar release. As discussed above, EG alone reduced fiber lengths and hence viscosity, but with limited impact on soluble sugar yield when measured in the present study.

Possible reasons why viscosity generally plateaus after a few hours of liquefaction, but glucan conversion continues to increase could be that (i) the short average fiber length was at a level where it is difficult to detect the differences with rheological measurements, especially at low solids loadings, (ii) fibers were degraded to an extent where most of the bound water in the cells are released to the mixture, so no further reduction in viscosity was seen, and (iii) the release of monomers did not affect rheology as much as fiber lengths. Glucan conversion alone cannot be used for direct quantification of viscosity, but a reduction in viscosity can improve the accessibility of other enzymes that contribute to soluble sugar release.

It is worth noting that these experiments were performed at 6 \% (w/w) total solids to maintain pumpability in the MRI setup, which is low compared to industrial applicability. However, it is expected that the effects that endoglucanase and endoxylanase have on improving rates of liquefaction would become more apparent at higher solids, for example, higher viscosities. Furthermore, as free bulk water becomes less available at higher solids, mass transfer limitations are expected to arise \citep{lavenson2012b,hodge2008}. This could likely have an impact on the extent of enzyme action, as mass transfer of enzyme to and from reaction sites as well as of released sugars away from the substrate may be hindered by the limited diffusion medium. This in turn could lead to an even larger discrepancy between the processes of saccharification and liquefaction than those shown here. Because of the probable synergistic relationship between reduction of viscosity and the subsequent increase in sugar release (Figure \ref{fig:fig6}), it is important to ensure proper liquefaction during hydrolysis to overcome mass transfer limitations, followed by saccharification with a more complete mixture of cellulases to ensure more thorough cellulose breakdown. The results shown here, which begin to elucidate the roles of endoglucanase and endoxylanase in liquefaction at 6\% (w/w) solids, may thus hold the key to overcoming mixing and pumping limitations at higher solids.

\section{Conclusion}
Wheat straw was hydrolyzed with various enzyme treatments to understand the role of endoglucanase and endoxylanase on the process of liquefaction. Viscosity was monitored inline throughout hydrolysis and samples were periodically taken to measure sugars and fiber sizes offline. Results showed that there is little correlation between the extent and rate of liquefaction and the overall conversion, as they are attributed to different enzyme modes of action. However, results did show that there is a relationship between reduction in viscosity and fiber attrition. Furthermore, endoglucanase and endoxylanase were found to primarily improve the rate of liquefaction, while the latter also enhanced xylan conversion. The reduction in viscosity can, however, improve overall sugar release if exoglucanases are present, as the results hinted at a potential synergistic relationship between these processes. How cellulases and xylanases are combined in relation to efficient liquefaction and saccharification of pretreated biomass is therefore of importance when designing a bioethanol process where high solids loadings are used.

A process for energy-efficient high-solids fed-batch enzymatic liquefaction of cellulosic biomass

\section{Abstract}
The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass is a key step in the biochemical production of fuels and chemicals. Economically feasible large-scale implementation of the process requires operation at high solids loadings, i.e., biomass concentrations >15\% (w/w). At increasing solids loadings, however, biomass forms a high viscosity slurry that becomes increasingly challenging to mix and severely mass transfer limited, which limits further addition of solids. To overcome these limitations, we developed a fed-batch process controlled by the yield stress and its changes during liquefaction of the reaction mixture. The process control relies on an in-line, non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rheometer to monitor real-time evolution of yield stress during liquefaction. Additionally, we demonstrate that timing of enzyme addition relative to biomass addition influences process efficiency, and the upper limit of solids loading is ultimately limited by end-product inhibition as soluble glucose and cellobiose accumulate in the liquid phase.

\section{Background}
Increasing global demand for energy has driven efforts toward developing forms of alternative energy that do not exhaust the limited resources available. Lignocellulosic biomass, abundant as agricultural residue, is a rich source of sugars and other organic compounds that can be extracted for further processing into fuels (such as ethanol) and other value-added chemicals, and is thus a promising source of energy. One pathway to access the structural sugars is the enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass that typically follows thermochemical pretreatment to reduce biomass recalcitrance. Cellulases saccharify the pretreated biomass to its component sugars, which are converted downstream to the target bio-products. However, scale-up of cellulose saccharification can quickly become costly \citep{humbird2011,humbird2010}. A potential route to lower process costs is to perform the hydrolysis step at high solids loadings of biomass (>15\% (w/w)) to lower water use while increasing the concentrations of desired chemicals in product streams. High solids processing, however, introduces mixing and pumping challenges due to the low availability of free water \citep{cannella2014,koppram2014,modenbach2013} which leads to inefficient mass and heat transfer in the reactions. Moreover, high solids biomass hydrolysis may require more specialized equipment like scraped-surface reactors and roller bottle reactors, which may be limited in capacity and can add to the overall cost of the process \citep{di2011,larsen2012,roche2009}. 

Biomass saccharification in fed-batch mode has been shown to be a viable means for hydrolysis at high solids loadings \citep{modenbach2013,rosgaard2007}. Fed-batch hydrolysis has been demonstrated using a variety of substrates including pretreated corn stover \citep{chandra2011,hodge2009}, sugarcane bagasse \citep{gao2014}, and paper \citep{elliston2013}; \citet{elliston2013}. achieved up to 65 \% (w/v) solids loading in a modified Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) process. By adding the substrate in batches, the enzymes are given time to liquefy the biomass to release water for the reaction and reduce particle size before more biomass is added. Batch additions of the substrate are typically done at regular time intervals. In one example, batch addition timing was optimized to maximize sugar yields \citep{gao2014}, which required significant preliminary work to successfully optimize. A potential improvement over timed additions of fixed amounts of substrate (e.g., 6\% solids added every 12 hours) is to control both the timing and biomass quantity based on the rheology of the reaction mixture to tailor the process to minimize overall reaction time and mixing energy. 

Rheology monitoring during fed-batch hydrolysis provides a way to adjust the process in real time so that batch additions are fully optimized. Viscosity is a readily measurable bulk-scale variable during enzymatic hydrolysis, and a means to in situ optimization of size and timing of batch additions. In a hydrolysis reaction, viscosity of the biomass slurry reduces rapidly to liquefy the reaction mixture due to endoglucanase activity \citep{skovgaard2014,szijarto2011,tozzi2014}. Upon liquefaction, more free water is available in the bulk, which allows for more biomass solids to be added to achieve a higher total solids content. In fed-batch mode, higher solids content can be reached by adding more biomass upon liquefaction. \citet{park2001} performed fed-batch hydrolysis using apparent viscosity (as a function of solids loading) as a control variable, and \citet{sjoede2013} have patented a continuous process in which viscosity is continuously monitored off-line by sampling; such approaches readily allow increasing solids to be added more efficiently, as additions are process-dependent and based on reaction feedback. However, these processes rely on off-line rheology measurements that are cumbersome, time-consuming and do not provide real-time feedback on the process.

We have improved the efficiency of fed-batch saccharification processes by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rheometry of flowing slurries to measure on-going changes in viscosity and yield stress of biomass to obtain time-resolved rheological data during liquefaction \citep{lavenson2011,skovgaard2014,tozzi2014}. We implemented this technique in hydrolysis experiments in fed-batch mode where in situ monitoring of yield stress was used as the control variable to determine the timing and amount of each batch addition. Liquefaction of biomass during enzymatic hydrolysis decreased slurry viscosity to reach a pseudo steady state \citep{skovgaard2014,tozzi2014}, signaling no further significant change in viscosity due to enzyme action, and that the biomass slurry is primed for further additions to reach higher solids contents. Thus, we used the onset of the steady state regime following liquefaction as the indicator for subsequent batch additions. We present results demonstrating the efficacy of yield stress controlled fed-batch hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass. We further explored the effects of timing of enzyme additions as differences have been observed in the past in total sugar released if all enzyme is added at the beginning versus in batches \citep{gao2014,rosgaard2007}. Likewise, timing of enzyme addition may have scale-up implications for further process optimization, thus we also investigated its impact on overall liquefaction extent and efficiency. 

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Experimental setup}
Enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were performed in a 10 liter recycle reactor connected to a continuous flow loop as previously described \citep{lavenson2011,tozzi2014} to allow for instantaneous acquisition of rheological data during liquefaction. A 50 mM sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.0 was added to the stainless steel tank feeding into the flow loop and was allowed to circulate to reach reaction temperature (50 \degree{C}). A constant temperature was maintained by a heat exchanger in the flow loop; the heat exchanger consisted of a five-turn stainless steel coil submerged in a 23 L thermostatic water bath (PolyScience 9610, Niles, IL). In-line temperature was also continuously monitored with a type K thermocouple to ensure isothermal conditions. Once the buffer was pre-heated, cellulosic fibers (Solka-Floc, International Fiber Corporation, Tonawanda, NY), and a commercial cellulase mixture (Cellic CTec2, Novozymes A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) were fed into the flow loop in a fed-batch manner. Amounts and concentrations added are detailed in Tables \ref{table:200ez}-\ref{table:enz0}. Samples of 15 ml were taken periodically from the feed tank for sugar and total solids analyses.

\subsection{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for rheological measurements}
In-line rheological measurements \citep{maneval1996,mccarthy1992,powell1994} during hydrolysis were performed in situ and non-invasively using an in-line magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) flow loop as previously demonstrated \citep{lavenson2011,skovgaard2014,tozzi2014}. An Aspect Imaging 1.03 T permanent magnet with a 0.3 T/m peak gradient strength (Aspect Imaging, Hevel Modi’in Industrial Area, Shoham, Israel) was used to obtain all images used in rheological analyses. The radio frequency coil encasing the imaging section of the pipe was a solenoid with three turns enclosing a volume 38 mm in diameter and 36 mm long. Velocity profiles as a function of radial position of the flowing biomass slurries were obtained throughout all experiments using a Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) sequence \citep{maneval1996,powell1994}. These velocity profiles, in conjunction with in-line differential pressure measurements, were used to obtain yield stresses during hydrolysis as shown in \citet{tozzi2014} and \citet{skovgaard2014}. Yield stresses were thus measured instantaneously and used for process control in the fed-batch setups detailed in Section \ref{sec:scheme}.

\subsection{Cellulosic substrates}
Two commercial delignified cellulosic fibers (Solka-Floc C100 and 200EZ) were used. Solka-Floc C100 and 200EZ mainly differed in their mean fiber length; C100 fibers are longer (mean fiber length: 0.444 mm) than 200EZ fibers (mean fiber length: 0.331 mm), and were otherwise similar in composition \citep{tozzi2014}. The solids content of the fibers was measured using a Mettler-Toledo Halogen Moisture Analyzer (model HR83, Mettler-Toledo International, Inc., Columbus, OH) and determined to be 7.28\% (w/w) and 7.44\% (w/w) for C100 and 200EZ fibers, respectively. Compositions of the fibers were determined as per National Renewable Energy Laboratory Analytical Procedures (NREL LAP) \citep{hames2008,sluiter2011,sluiter2008}(Hames et al., 2005; Sluiter et al., 2008a; Sluiter et al., 2008b) and are shown in Table \ref{table:comp}.

\end{table}

\subsection{Fed-batch process control}\label{sec:scheme}
Cellulosic fibers and cellulase enzymes were added to the recycle reactor in fed-batch mode. Yield stresses and in-line differential pressures of the biomass slurry were continuously measured, and these measurements were, in turn, used to decide when each batch addition was made. Figure \ref{fig:decision_scheme} depicts this decision-making scheme.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{fed-batch/decision_scheme-fig1}
  \caption[Fed-batch process control scheme.]{Fed-batch process control scheme. A) Biomass additions were made until the yield stress reached a predetermined maximum, at which point the slurry was allowed to liquefy by enzymatic action. B) Once yield stress reached a low steady state value, another biomass addition was made. The amount added was again dependent on the amount of biomass necessary to reach the maximum yield stress. C) Additions continued thusly for the duration of the experiments.}
  \label{fig:decision_scheme}
\end{figure}

Prior to any biomass addition, 50 mM sodium citrate buffer was heated to the reaction temperature of 50 \degree{C}, at which point the first biomass addition was made. Biomass was added until the yield stress reached or exceeded 15 Pa and 100 Pa for Solka-Floc C100 and 200EZ fibers, respectively. These yield stress maxima were based on equipment used and differ between fiber sources because the differences in fiber lengths affect their crowding behavior \citep{tozzi2014}. In other words, the longer C100 fibers behaved as a high consistency slurry at lower solids loadings than 200EZ fibers, which resulted in less C100 fibers added, comparatively, and therefore a lower yield stress (15 Pa) at the start of the experiment. Once the yield stress maximum was reached, Cellic CTec2 cellulases were added. The biomass was allowed to liquefy until the yield stress reached a low steady state value, at which point more biomass was added to reach the maximum yield stress again. If all enzymes were not added at the beginning of the trial, additional enzymes were also added at the point of biomass additions so as to maintain a constant enzyme-to-substrate ratio (5 FPU/g-biomass). This process was repeated for 12 hours of hydrolysis.  Tables \ref{table:200ez}-\ref{table:enz0} show the batch additions made during all fed-batch experiments. Table \ref{table:200ez} shows additions for the experiment performed with Solka-Floc 200EZ (shorter fibers) to demonstrate the total solids achievable in this setup when all the enzyme is added at the beginning. Tables \ref{table:enzB} and \ref{table:enz0} show additions using Solka-Floc C100 (longer fibers) as a substrate, showing two modes of enzyme addition: one in which enzymes were added with each batch addition of biomass maintaining constant enzyme-to-substrate ratio, ('ENZ$_{\text{B}}$'), and one in which the same total amount of enzyme was added at the start of hydrolysis (i.e., after the first biomass addition, 'ENZ$_{\text{0}}$'). In other words, the experiments in Tables \ref{table:enzB} and \ref{table:enz0} have the same total amount of biomass and enzymes added, with the only difference being in the timing of enzyme additions.


It is worth noting that in the experiment wherein all the enzyme was added at the beginning (Tables \ref{table:200ez} and \ref{table:enz0}), the enzyme loading as a function of biomass content (i.e. FPU/g-biomass) did not remain constant throughout the reaction, and changed with each batch addition of biomass. After the last biomass addition, both trials had an effective enzyme loading of 5 FPU/g-biomass. The enzyme loading at each biomass content is included in Tables \ref{table:200ez} and \ref{table:enz0}.
The apparent rate of liquefaction was determined from empirical fits to exponential decays in Figure \ref{fig:tau_conv},

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:liqrate_fedbatch}
\tau_{0} = a*e^{-b*t}
\end{equation}

where $\tau_{0}$ is the yield stress (Pa), $t$ is time (h), $a$ and $b$ are fitting constants, and an initial rate of liquefaction is given by the derivative of Equation \ref{eqn:liqrate_fedbatch} evaluated at $t =$ 0 hours, normalized for the start of each batch (i.e., time of batch addition). These fits are not meant as a universal model for liquefaction, but rather as an empirical tool for comparison between trials.

\subsection{ Analysis of samples }
Samples were periodically taken from the feed tank during experiments to measure total solids contents and soluble sugar concentrations. These measurements were used to determine glucan conversion over the course of hydrolysis. Hydrolysis was stopped prior to measurements by quenching in a water bath at 80 \degree{C} for 10 minutes.

\subsubsection{ Total solids measurements }
Total solids fractions were measured using both a Halogen Mettler Toledo Moisture Analyzer (model HR83, Mettler-Toledo International, Inc., Columbus, OH) and a vacuum oven drying method as shown by Weiss et al. (Weiss et al., 2010). In the Moisture Analyzer, samples were heated to 105 \degree{C} until there was less than a 0.05\% change in the weight of the sample, at which point the total solids fraction was determined based on the weight of water that evaporated.

\subsubsection{Sugar content measurement by High Performance Liquid Chromatography}
Hydrolyzate samples taken periodically from the flow loop return line were analyzed for soluble sugars by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD). Separation was carried out on an Aminex HPX-87P column with de-ashing and Carbo-P guard cartridges (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and sugar concentrations were measured by refractive index. The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min at 80 °C using nanopure water as the mobile phase. Calibration was performed with standard solutions of \textsc{D}-glucose, \textsc{L}-arabinose, \textsc{D}-xylose, \textsc{D}-mannose, \textsc{D}-galactose and \textsc{D}-cellobiose.

\subsubsection{Glucan conversion in high-solids fed-batch hydrolysis}
Glucose yields (unless stated otherwise) were determined as per \citet{zhu2011}, which was found fit for calculating yields for experiments performed at high solids loadings, in which the density of the liquid phase and the liquid volume in the reactor would be changing during the reaction. Glucose yields were calculated as follows,
	
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:conv_fedbatch}
Y_g=\frac{C_{g}\cdot V_{h}- C_{g,0}\cdot V_{h,0}}{\phi_{G}\cdot W_{t}\cdot f_{ts,0} \cdot X_{is,0}+\phi_{gos}\cdot C_{gos,0}\cdot V_{h,0}},
\end{equation}

where $Y_{g}$ is the glucose yield (as a fraction of 100), $C_{g}$ and $C_{g,0}$ are concentrations of glucose (g/L), $V_{h}$ and $V_{h,0}$ are volumes of the hydrolyzate, $\phi_{G}$ is the molecular weight ratio of glucose to glucan monomer (1.11), $W_{t}$ is the total weight of the hydrolysis assay (g), $f_{ts,0}$ is the initial mass fraction of total solids, $X_{is,0}$ is the initial mass fraction of insoluble solids in total solids (i.e., $f_{is,0}/f_{ts,0}$), $\phi_{gos}$ is the molecular weight ratio of glucose to average monomer weight of glucose oligomers (1.08), and $C_{gos,0}$ is the initial concentration of glucose oligomers \citep{zhu2011}. All terms in Equation \ref{eqn:conv_fedbatch} with subscript `0' correspond to initial values; in fed-batch setups, these changed with each batch addition and thus all reported glucose yields account for the changing amount of biomass in the reactor. Fraction of insoluble solids ($f_{is,0}$) was calculated based on the measured fraction of total solids ($f_{ts,0}$) and by using the method detailed by \citet{weiss2010}. Equation \ref{eqn:fis_fedbatch} details how it was calculated,

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:fis_fedbatch}
f_{is}=\frac{f_{ts}-y_{ss}}{1-y_{ss}},
\end{equation}

where $y_{ss}$ is the fraction component of soluble solids in the liquid of the slurry, or $m_{ss}/m_{l}$ (dimensionless), and $m_{ss}$ is the total mass of soluble solids (g, as determined by HPLC) and $m_{l}$ is the total mass of liquid in the slurry (g). Density of the slurry was approximated based on composition. Total solids and sugar concentration measurements were thus used to obtain glucose yields during high-solids hydrolysis.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Monitoring yield stress as a control variable to determine fed-batch addition and timing}
Yield stress was used as a process control variable during 12 hours of hydrolysis of Solka-Floc 200EZ (Figure \ref{fig:proof_of_concept}). Continuous monitoring of the suspension yield stress during the reaction provided a means to control the amount of biomass in each batch and the timing of the batch additions. The maximum amount of biomass that could be added at the start of the reaction and at each batch addition was limited by the maximum allowable yield stress of the flow loop equipment of 100 Pa. Following each batch addition, as the enzymes liquefied the substrate, the suspension yield stress dropped to a steady state indicating that the biomass slurry was able to contain more solids due to the increase in the availability of water in the bulk. Thus, the timing of subsequent batch additions was determined by the onset of this steady state. In the first few batch additions, liquefaction occurred very rapidly as indicated by precipitous drops in the suspension yield stress immediately following substrate addition (Figure \ref{fig:proof_of_concept}). By the fifth batch addition (hexagons in Figure \ref{fig:proof_of_concept}), a noticeable decrease in liquefaction rates was observed. With this fed-batch processing scheme, we increased total solids loading in the reaction from 16.9\% (w/w) solids to 30.7\% (w/w) solids over the 12 hour duration.

Lines are included to guide the eye.}
  \label{fig:proof_of_concept}
\end{figure}

Despite the continuous addition of fresh enzymes with each batch of substrate, glucan conversion slowed down rapidly within the first 2 hours of hydrolysis and tapered off at approximately 50\% by the end of the 12 hour reaction time. A relatively low overall enzyme loading was used (5 FPU/g-biomass), and glucan conversion was computed only from glucose and cellobiose release, which were the primary products of interest. Although glucose was the dominant contributor to glucan conversion (Figure \ref{fig:proof_sugars}A), a continuous increase in cellobiose concentration was observed as hydrolysis progressed. The accumulation of cellobiose strongly indicates end-product inhibition of $\beta$-glucosidases in the system. The glucose inhibition constant (K$_I$) for $\beta$-glucosidase ranges from 0.04 to 6 g/L on cellobiose \citep{andric2010}. Glucose concentrations surpass these values within the first few minutes of hydrolysis (22.6 g/L by 5 minutes of hydrolysis, Figure \ref{fig:proof_sugars}A). In addition, the cellobiose inhibition constant K$_I$ for crude \textit{T. reesei} cellulases on Solka-Floc has been reported as 2.3 g/L \citep{asenjo1983}. This concentration is exceeded after the third batch addition (5.1 g/L by 1 hour, Figure \ref{fig:proof_sugars}B), indicating that cellobiohydrolases are likely also inhibited. It is possible that cello-oligosaccharides were also accumulating during hydrolysis, but we did not measure these concentrations. Higher glucan conversions are likely achievable if end-products are separated and removed from the hydrolyzate.

Vertical lines indicate when batch additions of biomass were made.}
  \label{fig:proof_sugars}
\end{figure}

The data in Figure \ref{fig:proof_of_concept} demonstrate the feasibility of achieving higher solids loadings in the saccharification reaction with minimal increase in mixing energy and without needing specialized equipment such as scraped-surface reactors. We found the same results using longer cellulosic fibers, Solka-Floc C100 (Figure \ref{fig:tau_conv}). The two Solka-Floc substrates, 200EZ and C100, are compositionally similar but differences in their aspect ratios affect fiber crowding behavior and thereby the rheology of the fiber suspensions \citep{tozzi2014}.  As with the fed-batch operation using 200EZ, the maximum mass of C100 that could be added with each batch depended on the capability of both the system and the biomass slurry to take on additional solids that was assessed by monitoring the yield stress of the reaction. As noted previously in \citet{tozzi2014},  the longer fibers of C100 increases fiber-fiber interactions (higher crowding numbers) thereby reaching greater yield stress in the slurry at lower solids loadings.  Relying on concentrations is therefore not an effective means to determine batch additions in fed-batch mode.  Rather, suspension yield stress is a more effective process control variable when working with morphologically heterogeneous substrates. 

\subsection{Timing of enzyme addition affects liquefaction rates}
Figure \ref{fig:tau_conv} compares two fed-batch hydrolysis reactions of Solka-Floc C100 under identical reaction conditions and biomass additions, but differing in the timing of the enzyme addition. In the 'ENZ$_{\text{B}}$' reaction, enzymes were added with each batch addition of substrate at a constant enzyme-to-substrate (E/S) ratio, while in the ‘ENZ$_{\text{0}}$’ reaction, the total amount of enzyme was added at the beginning of the experiment. The overall E/S ratio in the ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ and ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ reactions were equivalent over the full course of the reactions (Tables \ref{table:enzB} and \ref{table:enz0}). The termination of the reaction at 12 hours was based on the onset of the steady state in liquefaction after the last batch addition in the ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ reaction.

Gray lines correspond to ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ and black correspond to ENZ$_{\text{0}}$.}
  \label{fig:tau_conv}
\end{figure}

Adding all the enzyme at the start of the hydrolysis reaction was beneficial for process efficiency as rapid liquefaction allowed earlier batch additions of substrate, thus achieving higher solids loadings faster (Figure \ref{fig:tau_conv} and Tables \ref{table:enzB} and \ref{table:enz0}). It took 6.5 hours to reach the final solids loading (19.3\% (w/w)) in ENZ$_{\text{B}}$, whereas the same additions were completed by 4.5 hours in ENZ$_{\text{0}}$. Initially, the E/S ratio was much higher in ENZ$_{\text{0}}$, as the enzyme loading was over double that of ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ (12.8 vs. 5 FPU/g-biomass in the first batch, respectively), which is likely the reason for the more rapid decline in yield stress in ENZ$_{\text{0}}$. However, after the addition of batch 5, where E/S loadings in ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ and ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ were more closely matched (5.76 FPU/g-biomass and 5 FPU/g-biomass, respectively), the biomass suspension yield stress in ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ took only approximately one hour to reach a steady state whereas it took nearly two hours in ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ (stars in Figure \ref{fig:tau_conv}A). These observations suggest that while a higher E/S ratio may account for initial improvements, additional factors are at play to make liquefaction more efficient in the later additions for ENZ$_{\text{0}}$. Liquefaction of biomass is largely attributed to fiber shortening by endo-activity in the cellulase mixtures \citep{skovgaard2014,tozzi2014}. Moreover, endoglucanases have been shown to be resilient under high-shear conditions \citep{ye2012}. Thus one possibility is that adding all the endo-acting enzymes at the beginning of the reaction gave more time for the full loading of endoglucanases to hydrolyze the substrate. Additionally, the longer exposure to the substrate added earlier in the reaction may allow for more release of constrained water, thus decreasing viscosities in the soluble phase and facilitating mass transfer of the same endoglucanases to biomass in subsequent additions \citep{roberts2011}. The addition of new biomass to an ongoing biomass hydrolysis reaction (as in fed-batch mode) has been shown to adversely affect glucose yields \citep{rosgaard2007}, so it is not surprising that it would also affect other modes of enzyme action (e.g., viscosity reduction). Therefore, adding all the enzymes at the beginning may serve to counteract the inhibitory effects of new substrate additions by more thoroughly liquefying the first batches of substrate. 

Estimates of the apparent initial rates of liquefaction following each batch addition show that ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ consistently liquefied at a faster rate than ENZ$_{\text{B}}$, even in later batch additions where effective enzyme loadings were similar (Figure \ref{fig:liqrates-headloss}A). The rates of liquefaction for the first batch addition for both ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ and ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ were much higher than the rest. This is consistent with prior observation that biomass additions may result in reduced enzyme activity due to insufficient reaction time to access the newer substrate \citep{rosgaard2007}. Overall, adding all cellulases initially facilitated increasing higher solids faster due to improved liquefaction efficiency.
	
\subsection{Timing of enzyme addition affects extent of saccharification}
Adding all enzyme initially (ENZ$_{\text{0}}$) resulted in higher glucan conversions in every batch, especially in the first addition (17.2\% versus 8.3\% conversion for ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ and ENZ$_{\text{B}}$, respectively). However, starting from the third batch addition (downward triangles in Figure \ref{fig:tau_conv}B), the curves are equidistant, indicating that glucan conversions between the two modes of addition become offset by the same amount. Moreover, glucan conversions in both reactions slow down considerably and plateau at around 40\% and 45\% for ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ and ENZ$_{\text{0}}$, respectively. 

\begin{figure}[H]

Gray lines correspond to ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ and black lines correspond to ENZ$_{\text{0}}$.}
  \label{fig:end-product-fig5}
\end{figure}

Glucose concentrations (Figure \ref{fig:end-product-fig5}A) continuously increased throughout hydrolysis, but plateaued for both ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ and ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ during the last 4 hours of hydrolysis. This plateau, just beyond 60 g/L glucose, may be due to end-product inhibition of $\beta$-glucosidases in the reaction. K$_I$ for $\beta$-glucosidase ranges from 0.04 to 6 g/L on cellobiose, which is exceeded in the first 10 minutes of hydrolysis for both ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ and ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ \citep{andric2010}. In both ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ and ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ reactions, cellobiose concentrations increased following each batch addition before decreasing again, suggesting a lag in the $\beta$-glucosidase activity compared to cellobiohydrolase activity in the reactions. In addition, during the last batch addition for both ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ and ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ (diamonds in Figure \ref{fig:end-product-fig5}B) cellobiose did not completely hydrolyze, but rather stabilized at a concentration of approximately 2 g/L. The plateau in glucose concentration coupled with the accumulation of cellobiose indicates end-product inhibition of $\beta$-glucosidases in the reaction.  Moreover, the stabilization of the cellobiose concentration further suggests that the cellobiohydrolases are not actively hydrolyzing cellulose in the reactions. Overall, ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ yielded more glucose, but this was likely due to the initial ``boost'' during the first batch when the enzyme-to-substrate ratio was much higher, but saccharification becomes highly end-product inhibited regardless of mode of enzyme addition. Separation or fermentation of products in the hydrolyzate from the unhydrolyzed biomass slurry may help reach higher conversions than those seen in these studies by overcoming or reducing end-product inhibition altogether. For instance, by converting this fed-batch saccharification process into a Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) process – where microorganisms that can ferment the sugar products are added to the same saccharification reactor – end products would be fermented, and end product accumulation and inhibition of cellulases would be avoided. Fed-batch SSF processes have been previously demonstrated \citep{elliston2013,rudolf2005}. 
 
As glucan conversion only measures release of glucose and cellobiose, it is hard to say what other effects on saccharification the mode of enzyme addition has, or whether the high-solids effects already mentioned (end-product inhibition, mass transfer limitations, high viscosities) affect the release of other components (e.g., pentoses, other oligosaccharides). The focus on glucan was due to the nature of the highly cellulosic composition of the substrate studied, but further research on the effects of enzyme addition on other physicochemical aspects of hydrolysis (e.g., particle size, oligosaccharide release and irreversibly bound enzyme concentrations) may provide more insight into kinetics at high solids. This is ultimately very desirable if scale-up at high solids contents is to be realized.

\subsection{Timing of enzyme addition affects process and energy efficiency}
Process efficiency is paramount when deciding processing parameters, and ultimately for successful scale-up. In both ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ and ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ reactions, the same equipment and reaction conditions were used, with the only difference being the timing of enzyme and biomass additions. Everything else being equal, the timing of biomass additions ultimately came down to the liquefaction efficiency of each setup, which directly affected the pumping requirements for each process. Given the same pumping power, a more liquefied, less viscous slurry experiences less frictional losses (i.e., energy dissipation) than a more viscous slurry. Frictional losses can be represented by head losses, or pressure losses, which can be characterized by the Darcy-Weisbach equation (Equation \ref{eqn:darcy}),

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:darcy}
h_{f}=f_{D}\cdot\frac{L}{D}\cdot\frac{\bar{V}^2}{2g},
\end{equation}

where the head loss due to frictional losses, $h_f$ (m), is a function of the pipe dimensions ($L$, length (m), and $D$, inner diameter (m)), mean fluid velocity $\bar{V}$ (m/s), acceleration due to gravity (g, m/s$^2$) and a dimensionless Darcy friction factor $f_D$, which is dependent on the Reynolds number of the fluid and pipe surface properties. Head loss, with units of length, is defined as the rise in fluid level in a vertical column in the absence of frictional losses. While head loss can be readily calculated at individual points in time for which we have pressure drop, velocity, and composition data (i.e., for all points in Figure \ref{fig:tau_conv}), in order to compare the two enzyme addition schemes it is more relevant to calculate the total head loss during each batch. The total head (m$\cdot$s) loss during a batch can be defined as the sum of instantaneous head losses (Equation \ref{eqn:head_loss}),

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:head_loss}
\text{Total head loss}= \sum_{i} h_{f,i}\cdot\Delta t,
\end{equation}

where $h_(f,i)$ are instantaneous values of head loss (m), and $\Delta t$ is time between head loss data points (s, i.e., the time between when $h_{f,i-1}$ and $h_{f,i}$ were obtained). Because head loss was determined at discrete points in time, a discrete sum was used to calculate total head loss. Figure \ref{fig:liqrates-headloss}B shows what total head losses were for each batch, for both setups, using Equations \ref{eqn:darcy} and \ref{eqn:head_loss}.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5.5in]{fed-batch/liqrates-headloss-fig6}
  \caption[Liquefaction efficiency depends on mode of enzyme addition.]{Liquefaction efficiency depends on mode of enzyme addition.

B) Total head loss of both modes of enzyme addition (ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ and ENZ$_{\text{0}}$, in white and black, respectively) for each batch addition. Error bars are from fitting confidence intervals (95\%).}
  \label{fig:liqrates-headloss}
\end{figure}

It is worth noting that the last batch addition continued past the onset of steady state, and therefore took a significantly higher amount of time than the other batches; this resulted in the total head loss values for the sixth batch addition being significantly higher than the rest (results not shown). Figure \ref{fig:liqrates-headloss} shows that total head losses were consistently higher for ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ than for ENZ$_{\text{0}}$, emphasizing again that adding all enzyme initially is desirable as it incurred lower energy losses. Lower head losses corresponded well with higher rates of liquefaction (Figure \ref{fig:liqrates-headloss}A). From Equation \ref{eqn:head_loss}, it is evident that because ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ batches spanned less time than ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ batches, total head loss per ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ batch is less than for the equivalent ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ batch. Furthermore, the improved liquefaction in ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ resulted in slightly larger Reynolds numbers for the biomass slurry due to slightly higher mean velocities and lower viscosities. The friction factor $f_D$ in Equation \ref{eqn:darcy} was calculated as 64/$Re$ for laminar flow in circular pipes \citep{metzner1955}, which means lower head losses for fluids with higher Reynolds numbers in smooth-walled pipes.

It is important to account for energy usage and losses when evaluating process efficiency; determining pumping head loss can become of high value considering the difficulty of pumping biomass at high solids concentrations. By looking at the total head loss, as well as rates of liquefaction and saccharification, we were able to determine that adding all the enzyme initially resulted in a more efficient process to reach and process high solids contents. 

This fed-batch process design can serve as a tool to study hydrolysis kinetics at high solids contents, varying substrates, enzyme activities and the timing of substrate and enzyme additions to provide deeper bulk-scale insights into the high solids effects during biomass saccharification. The current studies were done on delignified cellulosic fibers, and therefore results could be different on a lignocellulosic substrate due to compositional differences. However, initial studies on a model cellulosic substrate are still relevant to process scale-up. Past work on hydrothermally pretreated wheat straw, a substrate comprised of 29.5\% lignin, also showed fast decays in viscosity during liquefaction \citep{skovgaard2014}, indicating that a fed-batch setup that exploits liquefaction to get to higher solids contents could be used. Different enzyme feeding schemes in this process might help in improving saccharification rates on a lignocellulosic substrate. Saccharification is also significantly slower than liquefaction, thus with a lignocellulosic substrate, much longer hydrolysis times or higher enzyme loadings would be needed to improve on conversions seen here. Ultimately, altering modes of enzyme addition does have an impact on hydrolysis, and it provides an opportunity for process optimization.

\section{Conclusion}
A cellulosic substrate was hydrolyzed in fed-batch mode to easily attain high total solids loadings by using continuous monitoring of rheological changes in the biomass slurry. Adding all enzyme initially resulted in higher glucose yields and a more energy-efficient process due to faster liquefaction per batch and faster additions of solids. At high solids loadings, however, end-product inhibition becomes unavoidable without removal of products from the hydrolyzate. Overall, the platform and process design presented here are a valuable means by which to further understand the high-solids effects and hydrolysis kinetics at high solids loadings.

Does a liquefaction prehydrolysis step result in higher hydrolysis yields at high solids?



\section{Abstract}
In a high-solids hydrolysis process, efficient liquefaction is necessary to overcome viscosity limitations and enable efficient saccharification.
To test how a liquefaction-only step would impact overall hydrolysis yields in a fed-batch process, a series of two-batch experiments were run in a recirculating batch reactor using an endo-enhanced cellulase mixture. A procedure for enhancing endoglucanase activity in a commercial cellulase mixture (in lieu of purifying endoglucanases) was developed. The performance of this endo-enhanced mixture was then compared to that of the (untreated) commercial cellulase mixture in both enzyme activity assays and fed-batch hydrolysis experiments.  Hydrolysis experiments were done to compare hydrolysis performance during the second batch due to having a liquefaction-only first batch. In addition, rheological measurements were made with an \textit{in situ} magnetic resonance imaging rheometer to compare extents and rates of liquefaction of all trials. Results showed that a liquefaction-only step did not impact overall hydrolysis yields. The endo-enhanced enzyme mixture was, however, successful in simulating the effects of purified endoglucanase, which makes it a viable tool for qualitative tests for further fed-batch process optimization. 

\section{Background}
In the biochemical pathway for conversion of agricultural waste into ethanol and other value-added chemicals, the enzymatic hydrolysis step remains one of the biggest contributors the the overall processing cost per gallon of ethanol produced \citep{humbird2010}. In order to make the whole conversion process less cost-prohibitive, lignocellulosic biomass needs to be hydrolyzed at total solids loadings exceeding 15\% (w/w) \citep{modenbach2013}. At these solids loadings, however, biomass suspensions quickly become difficult to handle due to their high viscosities \citep{stickel2009}. Furthermore, a concomitant decrease in hydrolysis yields with increase in solids loadings occurs \citep{kristensen2009}, likely due to the poor mass transport in the bulk phase due to the limited availability of free water \citep{hodge2008}. During the initial stage of hydrolysis, however, fast changes in biomass suspension viscosity occur due to liquefaction by endo-acting enzymes \citep{szijarto2011,skovgaard2014}. Fast and efficient liquefaction may be key to quickly ``leaving'' the high-solids regime during early hydrolysis and enabling and improving subsequent saccharification yields. 

%that only represent a fraction of the sugars that could be released during hydrolysis (longer-chain oligosaccharides that may be released during hydrolysis are not included)

\citet{skovgaard2014} hinted at a possible synergy between liquefaction and saccharification, i.e., between endoglucanase and exoglucanase action. It is well known that liquefaction and saccharification are decoupled processes \citep{skovgaard2014}. On the one hand, saccharification (when reported) is quantified by the release of soluble monosaccharides and oligosaccharides (e.g., glucose and cellobiose). On the other hand, liquefaction is quantified by changes in viscosity and yield stress, bulk properties that are changing due to endo activity on the substrate \citep{skovgaard2014, szijarto2011}. Not only are these two processes measuring two different physicochemical changes, but they also occur at much different time scales, with liquefaction taking place within the first hour of hydrolysis \citep{tozzi2014, skovgaard2014}, and complete saccharification taking up to days and weeks to high levels of conversion  (for instance, 1.5 days for 75\%  conversion \citep{hamelinck2005}). Despite being decoupled, liquefaction and saccharification are also highly synergistic, especially at high solids loadings; with poor liquefaction, mass transport within the cellulosic slurry would remain poor, resulting in poor hydrolysis yields. Hydrolysis done with only exo-acting enzymes does not reach nearly as high levels of conversion as those done with full enzyme mixtures. 
In one study, cellobiohydrolase-I alone attained approximately 18\% conversion, whereas a complete \textit{Trichoderma} mixture reached 50\% conversion on Avicel after 72 hours of hydrolysis \citep{eibinger2014}. Efficient liquefaction and fast reduction in viscosity could be key to overcoming mass transfer limitations during hydrolysis at high solids loadings of biomass. 

%The aim of this work was to determine whether a liquefaction-only step would enhance extents of hydrolysis. End products (e.g., glucose and cellobiose) can inhibit liquefaction and saccharification (see Chapter \ref{ch:end-product} and \citet{andric2010}), so this experiment was set up as a two-batch experiment where the first batch was a liquefaction-only step, and the second a full hydrolysis step (i.e., with a full enzyme cocktail).
%All these different experiments are to enable scale-up of hydrolysis at high solids loadings. This one expands on the fed-batch work to see if this would be another enzyme feeding scheme that is beneficial, one in which only liquefying enzymes are added to attain high solids, and once those loadings are reached, a full cocktail is added on a liquefied, highly accessible substrate that would yield high concentrations of products with minimal waiting because it would be so liquefied. 

%Fed batch addresses that...
%[fed batch findings]

Fed-batch hydrolysis is a strategy to perform high-solids hydrolysis without incurring the high viscosities that would arise when doing experiments at similar loadings but in a batch setup. Fed-batch experiments using yield stress as a process control variable (Chapter \ref{ch:fed-batch}) were improved by a simple change in the mode of enzyme addition. A similar process scheme could be further optimized by adding individual purified enzymes at different time points in the process that are optimal for each of the enzymes. For instance, endoglucanases, which are inhibited by end products \citep{andric2010,gruno2004}, are the primary enzymes that liquefy cellulosic slurries \citep{skovgaard2014,szijarto2011}. Therefore, a process wherein endoglucanases are added to liquefy a high-solids biomass slurry with little to no glucose or cellobiose release may liquefy optimally. After that, exoglucanases may be added to start saccharification, since they will not be as inhibited because the slurry will be less viscous and would have more cellulose chain ends available for hydrolysis. Fed-batch experiments were done to test this potential route of optimization. Two-batch experiments were set up such that the first batch was done with mainly endoglucanases, and the second batch was done with a full cellulase mixture to determine if such an enzyme addition scheme results in improved hydrolysis due to performing each batch with one primary focus (i.e., batch 1: liquefaction, batch 2: saccharification).

%[purification background]
Purification of cellulases from an enzyme mixture involves several steps that generally include chromatographic separation by affinities, isoelectric points, and molecular weights \citep{wood1968,wood1978}. This process is time-consuming and have low throughput in a laboratory setting. In preliminary tests for biomass hydrolysis processes with purified enzymes, it may not be practical to purify endoglucanases when just initial qualitative assessments are needed. In this work, a process by which to isolate the endoglucanases in a commercial enzyme mixture was developed. This ``endo enhancement'' process took advantage of the different thermostabilities of cellulases in order to quench the majority of exocellulases while maintaining the activity of the endoglucanases that are more thermostable \citep{castillon1992,boer2003}. The resulting hydrolytic and viscometric activities of the endo-enhanced mixture were measured and compared to those of the starting mixture. This endo-enhanced mixture was used in large-volume (approximately 7 L) fed-batch experiments to test the effectiveness of a liquefaction pre-hydrolysis step on overall hydrolysis yields. 
%Future work to quantify this effect and to continue improving this process would require purified enzymes, but an endo-enhanced mixture was used here to understand governing qualitative trends.


%To test this hypothesis, a fed-batch process wherein only EG was used, followed by the full mixture would be good to see if there was a difference in performance.
%It's hard to purify large amounts of EG, so I designed a process to "enhance" the activity of EG to set up a fed-batch process in which there is a liquefaction/pre-hydrolysis step and then a normal hydrolysis step. 
%Heat treatment is one way to quench exo activity  since endos are a little more thermostable in Celluclast [CITE]. While not ideal, the two main things I measure are liquefaction (endo only) and saccharification (exo only), so if those activities are wheere I want them to be, then the cocktail would be good for a pseudo lqiuefaction only step with a endo-enhanced cocktail. 

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Enhancement of endoglucanase activity in Celluclast}
In order to enrich for endoglucanase activity in a cellulase mixture, a commercial cellulase mixture (Celluclast NS50013, batch CCN03132, Novozymes,  Bagsv{\ae}rd, Denmark) was heated to 65 \degree C for set times to quench exoglucanase activity and maintain as much endoglucanase activity as possible. The 65 \degree C setpoint was chosen based on the greater thermostability of endoglucanases (hereafter, ``EG'') than cellobiohydrolases (hereafter, ``CBH'') at 65 \degree C, and thus would remain active at that temperature long after CBH are quenched \citep{castillon1992,boer2003}. 

In microcentrifuge tubes, 200 $\mu$l samples of Celluclast (NS50013, batch CCN03132, Novozymes) were diluted ten-fold in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0) and submerged in a water bath (Isotemp, Thermo Scientific) set to 65 \degree C for different durations of time (0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours) to inactivate exoglucanases in the mixture. A ten-fold dilution was necessary since heating undiluted Celluclast resulted in the formation of a gel of denatured enzymes. Initial time trials were done to determine how long to heat the enzyme mixture to minimize CBH activity and maintain EG activity. After removal from the water bath, \textsc{p}NPL (\textsc{p}-nitrophenyl $\beta$-\textsc{d}-lactopyranoside), for CBH activity), \textsc{p}NPG (\textsc{p}-nitrophenyl glucopyranoside, for $\beta$-glucosidase activity), and CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose, for EG activity) assays were run to determine if the two conditions for an endo-enhanced mixture were attained:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Similar viscometric activity (i.e., EG activity) as the Celluclast control, and
\item Significantly reduced saccharification activity (i.e., exoglucanase activity) compared to the Celluclast control.
\end{enumerate} 

These assays are described below. Hereafter, Celluclast mixtures that were heat-treated will be referred to as ``endo-enhanced'' or ``EG$_{en}$'' (in the case of flow loop experiments). It is worth noting that there are other enzymes in Celluclast that were not tested for by these assays (e.g., xylanases); EG/CBH/$\beta$G were considered the primary contributors to liquefaction and saccharification for the purpose of these experiments on a primarily cellulosic substrate. Because the assays were done on an enzyme mixture (whether it is heated or not), the results are not to be treated as the activity of that assay's target enzyme alone, but rather as a general indicator of the effect of the heat treatment on enzymatic activity versus the unheated, control sample.

\subsection{Enzymatic activity assays}
\subsubsection{\textsc{p}-nitrophenyl assays for $\beta$-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase activities}
In individual wells in a 96-well plate, 100 $\mu$l of each enzyme sample (after heat treatment) and 100 $\mu$l of 1 mg/ml \textsc{p}-nitrophenyl $\beta$-\textsc{D}-lactopyranoside or \textsc{p}-nitrophenyl $\beta$-\textsc{D}-glucopyranoside solution (Sigma-Aldrich) (for cellobiohydrolase and $\beta$-glucosidase activities, respectively) were added. The plate was then incubated in a heated microplate shaker (VWR, Radnor, PA) set to 100 RPM and 50 \degree C for 1 hour. After incubation, 100 $\mu$l of 1 M sodium bicarbonate was added to each plate to quench the hydrolysis reaction. Each sample was done in triplicate, with blank (50 mM sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.0) and control (untreated Celluclast) wells (also in triplicate) included. Concentrations of glucose (from \textsc{p}NPG) and cellobiose (from \textsc{p}NPL) were measured at $\lambda$ = 405 nm with a UV-Vis microplate spectrophotometer (Synergy, BioTek, Winooski, VT) ($\epsilon_{405}$ = 16,608 M$^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$) to determine $\beta$-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase activities, respectively \citep{irwin1993}.


\subsubsection{Carboxymethyl cellulose viscometric assay for endoglucanase activity} \label{section:CMC_time}
A 0.5\% (w/v) carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, M.W. 800,000, Sigma-Aldrich) solution in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0) was prepared by slowly adding 0.5 g of CMC to 100 ml of buffer with continuous stirring. A Cannon Fenske size 100 viscometer (Cannon Instrument Company, State College, PA) was placed in a 30 \degree C water bath (Haake DC10, Thermo Scientific) so that the parts of the viscometer containing the solution were fully submerged. For each trial, 1 ml of enzyme sample (ten-fold diluted, unless stated otherwise) was mixed with 6 ml of 0.5\% (w/v) CMC and pipetted into the Cannon-Fenske viscometer. Every ten minutes the efflux time was measured by drawing the solution above the top measurement line, and measuring the time for the solution meniscus to travel from the top line to the bottom line of the viscometer measurement region. Efflux times were converted to kinematic viscosity values (cSt, $\nu$) by multiplying by a factor of 0.015 cSt/s (manufacturer's calibration coefficient). Efflux times were measured for one hour \citep{wood1988}. In addition, the efflux time of a blank sample (1 ml of buffer and 6 ml of 0.5\% (w/v) CMC solution) was measured and used as the time 0 kinematic viscosity ($\nu_{0}$). All kinematic viscosities were normalized against this time 0 measurement (i.e., $\nu/\nu_{0}$) in order to account for both experimental constraints of time 0 measurements of enzyme samples due to mixing times and differences in viscosity between enzyme samples. In order to compare viscometric activities between enzyme samples, Equation \ref{eqn:CMC} was used to fit normalized kinematic viscosity versus assay time,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:CMC}
\nu_{norm}=a*e^{-b*t}+c
\end{equation}
where $\nu_{norm}$ is the normalized kinematic viscosity (dimensionless), $t$ is the assay time (min), and $a$ (dimensionless), $b$ (min$^{-1}$), and $c$ (dimensionless) are fitting constants. All fits were done using nonlinear least squares fitting in MATLAB (Mathworks, Nattick, MA). The derivative of Equation \ref{eqn:CMC} at time 0, $-a*b$ (min$^{-1}$) was the liquefaction rate of CMC (here reported as positive values for ease of comparison).

\subsubsection{Matching viscometric activity for in-line experiments}
In order to compare the liquefaction performance of endo-enhanced Celluclast and Celluclast in flow loop experiments, the off-line viscometric activity of both had to be matched such that similar liquefaction behavior would be expected in the flow loop. For flow loop experiments, Celluclast at a loading of 5 FPU/g-biomass in 6.3 L of buffer resulted in a 1/160 dilution (enzyme-to-buffer volume ratio). After heat treatment for 30 minutes, endo-enhanced Celluclast samples were diluted to different concentrations --- 1/10, 1/100, 1/150, and 1/160 (enzyme-to-buffer volume ratio)\footnote{These dilution factors are with respect to the original Celluclast volume used for endo enhancement. Since samples were diluted 10X prior to heat treatment, the endo-enhanced samples were actually diluted to concentrations of 1/1, 1/10, 1/15, and 1/16 (enzyme-to-buffer volume ratio) for these experiments.}---and their CMC viscometric activities were compared to that of 1/160 Celluclast. Viscometric activities were compared based on rates of liquefaction of CMC (see Equation \ref{eqn:CMC}). These rates were used to determine the dilution factor on a volume basis of endo-enhanced enzyme to be used in the flow loop for a liquefaction-only batch. 

\subsection{Enzymatic hydrolysis experiments}
Enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were performed in a 10 liter recycle reactor connected to a continuous flow loop as previously described \citep{tozzi2014,skovgaard2014}. A fed-batch experiment with only two batch additions was run in the flow loop setup to simulate a hydrolysis process with a pre-hydrolysis (liquefaction only) step. The conditions for the first batch were varied so as to represent a pre-hydrolysis step, and the conditions for the second batch were kept similar for all trials. The enzyme used in the second batch in all trials was Celluclast at 50 \degree C. Each batch lasted one hour, for a total experimental time of two hours for each trial. For the control trial (CC-CC), the enzyme loading used for both batches was 5 FPU/g-biomass (Celluclast NS50013, batch CCN03132). A similar loading was used for trial CC*-CC. The names given to each trial (CC-CC, EG$_{en}$-CC, and CC*-CC) will be used hereafter; the first pair of letters corresponds to the enzyme treatment used in the first batch, and the second pair of letters corresponds to the enzyme treatment used in the second batch (CC: Celluclast, CC*: Celluclast at 65 \degree C, EG$_{en}$: endo-enhanced Celluclast). Additions for all trials are detailed in Table \ref{table:feedscheme_eg}.



Prior to biomass and enzyme additions, 6.3 L of 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0) were added to the flow loop and recirculated until the fluid temperature reached reaction temperature (50 \degree C for trials CC-CC and EG$_{en}$-CC and 65 \degree C for trial CC*-CC), at which point 548 g of Solka-Floc C100 (International Fiber Corporation, Tonawanda, NY) (composition: 71.5\% glucan, 7.1\% xylan, and 5.1\% mannan) were added for a total solids loading of 7.45\% (w/w). After approximately 45 minutes of homogenization of buffer and biomass, enzymes were added. After one hour of hydrolysis, the second batch was added: 167 g of Solka-Floc C100 and 12 ml of Celluclast, for a final solids loading of 9.47\% (w/w) and an enzyme loading of 5 FPU/g-biomass. Samples were collected regularly for off-line analysis of sugars in the hydrolyzate with High Performance Liquid Chromatography. It is worth noting that the enzyme volumes detailed in Table \ref{table:feedscheme_eg} refer to undiluted Celluclast volumes. In the case of the first batch in trial EG$_{en}$-CC, 39 ml of Celluclast were first diluted ten-fold in 350 ml of 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0) and divided into 8 x 50-ml conical tubes prior to placing in the water bath for heat inactivation of enzymes. This was done to ensure uniform heating throughout samples. Because 350 ml of buffer were used during enzyme preparation, only 5.95 L of buffer were added to the flow loop at the start of hydrolysis, with the rest being added at the time of enzyme addition.

Throughout flow loop runs, yield stress was continuously monitored in-line with MRI velocimetry as detailed in Chapter \ref{ch:methods} and previously demonstrated \citep{tozzi2014,skovgaard2014}. A Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo sequence was used for all image acquisitions, using an Aspect Imaging spectrometer and 1 T magnet with peak gradient strength of 0.3 T/m (Aspect Imaging, Hevel Modi'in Industrial Area, Shoham, Israel). The imaged section of the flow loop was a pipe with ID of 17.78 mm that was placed in a solenoid radio frequency coil with 4 turns, 60 mm in diameter and 60 mm long. Slice thickness and field of view (FOV) for these experiments were 50 mm and 40 mm, respectively. Velocity Sweep Width (VSW) and repetition time and echo time (TR and TE, respectively) were adjusted over the course of hydrolysis to maximize signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The flow rate throughout all trials was 13.3 L/min using a positive displacement pump (Moyno, Springfield, OH). 

\subsection{Hydrolysis product characterization using High Performance Liquid Chromatography}
Hydrolyzate samples taken periodically from the flow loop return line were analyzed for soluble sugars by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD). Enzymes were quenched by placing the sample containers in a 90 \degree C water bath for 10 minutes. Samples were then centrifuged and filtered prior to analysis. Separation was carried out on an Aminex HPX-87P column with de-ashing and Carbo-P guard cartridges (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and sugar concentrations were measured by refractive index. The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min at 80 \degree C using nanopure water as the mobile phase. Calibration was performed with standard solutions of \textsc{d}-glucose, \textsc{l}-arabinose, \textsc{d}-xylose, \textsc{d}-mannose, \textsc{d}-galactose and \textsc{d}-cellobiose. Glucan conversion was calculated as per \citet{zhu2011} due to the solids loadings used in these experiments. Detailed calculations were done as shown in Chapters \ref{ch:methods} and \ref{ch:fed-batch}.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Optimization of heat treatment times for endo enhancement of Celluclast}
Figure \ref{fig:assay_time} shows the \textsc{p}NPL, \textsc{p}NPG, and viscometric activities of Celluclast endo-enhanced at 65 \degree C for various extents of time.  

\begin{figure}[H]

Error bars are from triplicate measurements.}
  \label{fig:assay_time}
\end{figure}

One hour seemed sufficient to quench cellobiohydrolase (CBH) activity (as shown in Figure \ref{fig:assay_time}A, \textsc{p}NPL) while maintaining most of the starting endoglucanase (EG) activity (as shown in Figures \ref{fig:assay_time}B and C). Longer times (i.e., 2, 4, 6 h) did not reduce CBH activity (Figure \ref{fig:assay_time}A) significantly more, whereas significant EG activity was lost with longer heating times (Figure \ref{fig:assay_time}D). $\beta$-glucosidase ($\beta$G) activity was relatively unaffected by heat treatment. For the purposes of inhibiting saccharification however, since CBH activity is reduced, little cellobiose would be released from the substrate, which in turn means little to no cellobiose for $\beta$G to hydrolyze, as $\beta$G mainly acts on the soluble fraction of the sugars \citep{sternberg1976}. Based on these results, 30 minutes and 1 hour of heat inactivation times were chosen for endo enhancement of Celluclast to be used in flow loop hydrolysis studies.


To match viscometric activities of Celluclast and endo-enhanced Celluclast, various dilutions of endo-enhanced Celluclast were compared with a 1/160 dilution (enzyme-to-buffer volume ratio) of Celluclast so as to obtain the proper dilution factor to use in flow loop experiments.
Figure \ref{fig:CMC_match} shows results of \textsc{p}NPL, \textsc{p}NPG, and CMC viscometric assays done on various dilutions of endo-enhanced Celluclast. In the case of endo-enhanced samples, Celluclast was diluted ten-fold prior to heat inactivation, and then again diluted to a final concentration of 1/100, 1/150, and 1/160 (enzyme-to-buffer volume ratio). 

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering

Error bars in A and B are from triplicate measurements, and error bars in C are from fitting confidence intervals (Equation \ref{eqn:CMC}).}
  \label{fig:CMC_match}
\end{figure}

For some of these experiments, samples were heated for 30 minutes instead of one hour to see whether more EG activity could be maintained in the sample while still removing most of the CBH activity. Prior studies on heat inactivation of Celluclast showed almost all filter paper unit (FPU) activity, another indicator of saccharification activity, was lost within 15 minutes at 65 \degree C \citep{skovgaard2013}. In the case of CBH (Figure \ref{fig:CMC_match}A), 30 minutes of inactivation was sufficient to remove most of its activity. Similar to the time trials shown in Figure \ref{fig:assay_time}B, $\beta$G activity was unaffected by 30 minutes of inactivation (Figure \ref{fig:CMC_match}B). Lastly, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:CMC_match}C, a 1/160 dilution of endo-enhanced Celluclast heated for 30 minutes (second-to-last bar) most closely matched the viscometric activity of the control (1/160 Celluclast). Therefore, a 1/160 dilution of endo-enhanced Celluclast heated for 30 minutes was used for trial EG$_{en}$-CC during flow loop experiments. Since this was the same dilution as the control, it simplified the mass balance of both trials and allowed for more straightforward comparison between trials. If, for instance, a 1/100 dilution of endo-enhanced Celluclast (heated for 60 minutes) were used instead, viscometric activities would be similar (see Figure \ref{fig:CMC_match}C), but flow loop liquefaction and saccharification results would be confounded by the fact that higher concentrations of other enzymes would also be present.

%It is worth noting that a variety of different enzymes (e.g., endoxylanases, $\beta$-glucosidases) are also present in Celluclast whose activities these assays do not assess. However, XXX (60 \%? by composition) of Celluclast is comprised of Cel7A (a CBH), which acts by cleaving cellobiose off cellulose chain ends, and the next notable enzyme in Celluclast at play during liquefaction is EG (Cel7B, XX \% by composition) [CITE?]. Without purification, it is difficult to truly isolate EG activity in an enzyme mixture. However, these two enzymes (EG and CBH) were targeted as they ar primarily at play in depolymerizing cellulose, one by cleaving it into shorter-chain polysaccharides, and one by cleaving cellobiose from reducing ends. Thus, removing saccharifying activity would isolate liquefying activity for use in large-volume trials.

%Over different times of heat-treatment of Celluclast, it seemed that cellobiohydrolase (CBH) activity was quickly quenched, which meant that 30 minutes was sufficient incubation time. One hour achieved the same effect, but with some loss in endoglucanase (EG) activity. For flow loop trials, it was unfeasible to purify large amounts of endoglucanase due to experimental constraints, so these assays were deemed sufficient to establish that the Celluclast added to the flow loop would not release cellobiose during hydrolysis.
%$\beta$-glucosidase ($\beta$G) activity was not changed significantly within incubation times. $\beta$G is a more thermostable enzyme [CITE]. It would have been ideal to quench both CBH and $\beta$G activities, but since $\beta$G acts on cellobiose in the soluble part of the substrate, this was not a concern. In other words, if CBH is not releasing cellobiose from the insoluble substrate, $\beta$G has little to act on, so the enzyme cocktail would hypothetically be only releasing oligosaccharides due to EG activity still present. Furthermore, Celluclast is generally supplemented with $\beta$-glucosidases in the form of Novo 188 [CITE], meaning that the activity of $\beta$G in the Celluclast used during these experiments is small in relation to that of other enzymes.

Overall, this procedure seemed successful in ``enhancing'' or isolating EG activity while reducing CBH activity, and would be useful for experiments wherein large volumes of EG are needed. Purification of large amounts of EG from an enzyme mixture can be resource-intensive, and this endo-enhanced mixture could work well for initial assessments and preliminary experiments. It is not necessarily pure (as glucose was still released from $\beta$-glucosidase presence), but would still be helpful in validating bulk scale properties of biomass liquefaction.

%As a note, matching the endo-enhanced Celluclast wth the control on a protein concentration basis was attempted, but those results are not included. A standard Bradford assay [CITE] was done to determine how much endo-enhanced Celluclast to add to match protein concentration of the control Celluclast. However, protein concentrations of the whole enzyme cocktail fails to differentiate between enzymes, and the goal of doing a liquefaction-only batch was better achieved by amtching liquefaction activities of a known part of the enzyme cocktail.


\subsection{Fed-batch flow loop experiments with endo-enhanced Celluclast}
\subsubsection{Fed-batch liquefaction}
Fed-batch experiments with two batch additions were done to compare the hydrolysis performance of endo-enhanced Celluclast against a Celluclast control. Figure \ref{fig:liquef} shows yield stress as a function of time over the two hours of hydrolysis, where a second batch addition was done at $t=1$ h. Decays in yield stress were seen with the onset of liquefaction in trials CC-CC and EG$_{en}$-CC. Rates of liquefaction are thus included in Figure \ref{fig:liquef}B for reference, and were obtained by fitting exponential decay curves to yield stress over time (see Equation \ref{eqn:liqrate_fedbatch}). The first batch of trial CC*-CC (triangles in Figure \ref{fig:liquef}A) was done at 65 \degree C with Celluclast to attempt in-line endo enhancement of Celluclast (i.e., similar conditions and time of heat inactivation as EG$_{en}$-CC, but done in the flow loop instead).

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5.5in]{eg/liq_eg}
  \caption[Fed-batch liquefaction with endo-enhanced Celluclast]{A) Fed-batch liquefaction with Celluclast (CC-CC, circles), endo-enhanced Celluclast (EG-CC, squares), and in-line inactivated Celluclast (CC*-CC, triangles) over two hours of hydrolysis. B) Rates of liquefaction of each batch of CC-CC (black) and EG$_{en}$-CC (gray). Error bars are from fitting confidence intervals of Equation \ref{eqn:liqrate_fedbatch}.}
  \label{fig:liquef}
\end{figure}

A sharp increase in yield stress was seen upon addition of the second batch of Solka-Floc in all trials ($t = 1$ h). The spike was more pronounced when the first batch was done with heat inactivated enzymes (Trials EG$_{en}$-CC and CC*-CC, squares and triangles in Figure \ref{fig:liquef}A, respectively). Despite the larger increase in EG$_{en}$-CC versus CC-CC,  the rate of liquefaction was higher in trial EG$_{en}$-CC than trial CC-CC during the second batch (Figure \ref{fig:liquef}B). In trial CC*-CC (triangles in Figure \ref{fig:liquef}A), where heat-inactivation of Celluclast was done in-line, there was no apparent liquefaction during the first batch, and the yield stress continued to increase during the second batch. It was likely that enzymes were not only heat inactivated at the elevated temperature, but also shear inactivated under flow conditions \citep{reese1980}, causing irreversible inactivation of endoglucanases beyond that caused by heat treatment in a water bath. During CC*-CC, the flow loop temperature was adjusted to 50 \degree C at 40 minutes of hydrolysis to allow for sufficient time for the entire system to reach 50 \degree C by $t=1$ h, the second batch addition. After the second addition of CC*-CC, yield stress continued to increase (and sugars were not released; see Figure \ref{fig:sugars_eg}), indicating that the CC addition did not behave as it did in the second batch of trials EG$_{en}$-CC and CC-CC. It is possible that 20 minutes of cooling was not enough time to bring the temperature of the entire system to 50 \degree C, which irreversibly inactivated the enzymes added during the second batch addition. This trial was intended as in-line endo enhancement via heat inactivation of cellobiohydrolases only, but all that was achieved was in-line heat inactivation of most enzymes. At the start of the second batch ($t=1$ h), the increase in yield stress due to biomass addition was similar in trials CC-CC and EG$_{en}$-CC, but it continued to increase (similarly to blank runs on Solka-Floc; data not shown) instead of decreasing due to liquefaction. If it had liquefied similarly to trial EG$_{en}$-CC (with off-line endo-enhanced Celluclast), then it had potential to be a way to do a liquefaction-only step without purification of enzymes by endo-enhancing Celluclast in-line. Flowing conditions at high temperatures caused unquantified irreversible inactivation of enzymes.

Rates of liquefaction (Figure \ref{fig:liquef}B) were reduced from the first to the second batch in trial CC-CC (control), but were increased in trial EG$_{en}$-CC. In trial CC-CC, it is likely that some liquefaction activity was lost due to shear inactivation of enzymes, as a similar reduction was seen with similar fed-batch experiments (Figure \ref{fig:liqrates-headloss}). During the first batch of EG$_{en}$-CC, the liquefaction rate was less than that of CC-CC, which means that viscometric activities were not matched. Off-line experiments on CMC compared the liquefaction of a derivative of cellulose (i.e., with added carboxymethyl side groups), with the liquefaction of cellulose in Solka-Floc. In addition, Solka-Floc C100 also contained hemicellulose (xylan content: 7.1\%, mannan content: 5.1\%). It is possible that heat treatment also affected other endo-acting enzymes not assessed by the CMC viscometric assays. After the second batch addition, the yield stress increase in EG$_{en}$-CC was higher than CC-CC, and it is possible that the rate of liquefaction appears higher because more work is required by the endoglucanases in CC during EG$_{en}$-CC to get to steady state during the second batch. Fits of rates of liquefaction were empirical, however, and all rates shown in Figure \ref{fig:liquef}B appear similar within error bounds, and thus main differences arise in the spike in yield stress after an addition and the final steady state value of yield stress. 

%After the second batch addition, however, the rate of liquefaction of EG$_{en}$-CC was higher than CC-CC, likely because during that addition, a full mixture of Celluclast was added, and thus the rate matched that of the first batch of CC-CC with a similar enzyme addition.

\subsubsection{Fed-batch saccharification}
Glucan conversion results of all trials are shown in Figure \ref{fig:conv}. In trials EG$_{en}$-CC and CC*-CC, CBH was inactivated, thus little conversion was expected during the first batch ($t<1$ h), except from residual CBH or $\beta$G activity. In order to determine whether a difference in conversion resulted from a liquefaction-only batch, glucan conversions were normalized with respect to the conversion at the end of the first batch in Figure \ref{fig:conv}B, i.e., glucan conversion ``boost''$=$ glucan conversion at $t>1$ h $-$ glucan conversion at $t=1$ h. The second batch additions were identical for all trials, so any differences in Figure \ref{fig:conv}B were from effects that carried over from the first batch.

%Since \textsc{p}NPG results showed little to no change in $\beta$-glucosidase activity, not much difference was expected in terms of glucose released among different trials. 

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{eg/gluc_conversion}
  \caption[Fed-batch saccharification with endo-enhanced Celluclast]{A) Fed-batch saccharification with Celluclast (CC-CC, circles), endo-enhanced Celluclast (EG-CC, squares), and in-line inactivated Celluclast (CC*-CC, triangles) over two hours of hydrolysis. B) Glucan conversion ``boost'' during the second batch for all trials (i.e., conversion during second batch only, wherein all enzyme additions were the same.)}
  \label{fig:conv}
\end{figure}


As expected, higher conversions were achieved in the first batch ($t<1$ h) when the full enzyme mixture was used at 50 \degree C (CC-CC) than when CBH activity was quenched in the heat-inactivation process (both in-line and off-line, CC*-CC and EG$_{en}$-CC, respectively). Because of this, higher conversions were achieved after 2 hours of hydrolysis in the control (CC-CC) trial (5.5\% of theoretical). Trials EG$_{en}$-CC and CC*-CC only achieved 2.7\% and 0.17\% conversion, respectively. Figure \ref{fig:conv}B shows glucan conversion ``boost'' to determine whether a liquefaction-only step was beneficial for saccharification during the second batch ($t>1$ h). Because the control (CC-CC) had a full enzyme mixture from the start of hydrolysis, this normalization was done to take away that advantage at the start of the second batch addition ($t=1$ h). Overall, no improvement or significant loss in conversion were seen with a liquefaction-only batch (EG$_{en}$-CC) during the second batch. Saccharification occurred at similar rates for trials CC-CC and EG$_{en}$-CC (see slopes in Figure \ref{fig:conv}B). In-line heat inactivation (CC*-CC) showed no improvement during the second batch, and in fact performed the worst of all trials in conversion and liquefaction. If it had shown glucan conversions similar to trial EG$_{en}$-CC, then in-line heat inactivation of CBH would have been a viable way to perform a liquefaction-only batch without needing purification of endoglucanases. However, as seen in liquefaction results (Figure \ref{fig:liquef}A), it is possible that enzymes were inactivated more in-line than off-line due to shear under flowing conditions, which is why glucan conversions did not match between EG$_{en}$-CC and CC*-CC during the first batch ($t<1$ h). Furthermore, 20 minutes of cooling were likely not enough to bring the entire slurry from 65 \degree C to 50 \degree C. The elevated temperatures at the time of the second batch addition in CC*-CC may have inactivated the CC enzymes added at $t=1$ h. Otherwise, rates of saccharification during the second batch (i.e., slopes of curves in Figure \ref{fig:conv}B) would have been similar to those of trials CC-CC and EG$_{en}$-CC, as all trials had identical additions during the second batch, and the only differences between performance during the second batch would have been from effects carried over from the first batch ($t<1$ h). 

Concentrations of glucose, cellobiose, and xylose released during hydrolysis are shown in Figure \ref{fig:sugars_eg}. As expected, trials in which CBH activity was quenched (EG-CC and CC*-CC) released less glucose and cellobiose than the control trial with a full enzyme mixture (CC-CC) during the first batch ($t<1$ h) and after 2 hours of hydrolysis.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \label{fig:sugars_eg}
\end{figure}

%indicating that either CBH activity was not completely quenched (as evidenced by Figure \ref{fig:CMC_match}A where \textsc{p}NPL activity was not gone after endo enhancement of Celluclast).

Glucose concentrations after the first batch ($t<1$ h) in EG$_{en}$-CC was not 0, which was likely due to $\beta$G activity (as evidenced by Figure \ref{fig:CMC_match}B where \textsc{p}NPG activity was not gone after endo enhancement of Celluclast) or EG activity (which can release glucose even when purified; see Chapter \ref{ch:egxyl}). In the second batch, the rates of release of both glucose and cellobiose were similar for the control (CC-CC) and EG$_{en}$-CC trials. As similar loadings of enzyme were added at the start of the second batch in both those trials, it makes sense that saccharification occurred at similar rates during the second batch ($t>1$ h). A liquefaction-only first batch (batch 1 in EG$_{en}$-CC) did not result in improvements in saccharification during the second batch. Almost no glucose or cellobiose were released in CC*-CC, indicating stronger inactivation of CBH, $\beta$G, and potentially other enzymes when heat inactivation was done in-line. Heat inactivation of EG (as evidenced by the lack of liquefaction during the first batch of CC*-CC) also limited the potential activity of any residual exoglucanase activity.

Concentrations of xylose released varied between trials as shown in Figure \ref{fig:sugars_eg}C, which may hint at the effect of heat inactivation on xylanases. Significantly less xylose was released in EG$_{en}$-CC and CC*-CC, indicating that xylanases in Celluclast were also inactivated. Activity assays were not run to determine xylanase activities, but it is likely that both xylan conversion and liquefaction were affected by the inactivation of xylanases. \citet{skovgaard2013} showed that significant endoxylanase activity in Celluclast was lost after 10 minutes at 65 \degree C, so it is likely the same occurred during these heat inactivation trials. Furthermore, \citet{skovgaard2014} found that the addition of xylanases improved liquefaction of wheat straw (xylan content: 10.8\%). Despite the low xylan content in Solka-Floc (7.1\%), it is likely that loss of xylanase activity also affected overall liquefaction and xylan conversion of Solka-Floc. Overall, endo-enhancement of Celluclast worked well to reduce CBH activity while maintaining EG activity, but the effects of heat inactivation on other cellulases or hemicellulases in Celluclast has yet to be quantified. 

%, and thus it is possible that the heat inactivation of xylanases resulted on liquefaction rate differences during the first batches of CC-CC versus both EG$_{en}$-CC and CC*-CC (see Figure \ref{fig:liquef})
%\section{REMOVE: Discussion}

\subsection{A liquefaction-only step did not improve overall hydrolysis}
The idea of liquefaction and saccharification synergy as put forth by \citet{skovgaard2014} that successful hydrolysis cannot happen without successful liquefaction was tested. A liquefaction-only step (as in trial EG$_{en}$-CC) did not improve overall hydrolysis yields. However, both EG$_{en}$-CC and CC-CC, which were liquefied to a similar extent by the end of the first batch, had a similar extent of hydrolysis during the second batch alone (see glucan conversion ``boost,'' Figure \ref{fig:conv}B), highlighting the synergy between extent of liquefaction and subsequent saccharification. Some differences in liquefaction behavior were seen between trials EG$_{en}$-CC and CC-CC, despite the fact that viscometric activities were matched off-line for the first batch, and identical enzyme treatments were used in the second batch. In other words, both trials should have liquefied identically. The differences in yield stress ``spikes'' and final steady state values may be due to differences in xylanase activity, which was affected by heat inactivation to an unknown extent. Although the bulk of liquefaction may be due to endoglucanase activity, other enzymes (i.e., xylanases) likely play a non-trivial role in liquefaction when the substrate contains hemicellulose (as Solka-Floc does).

In-line inactivation of CBH (CC*-CC trial) not only inhibited liquefaction during both batches, but it also harmed overall saccharification. Little glucose, cellobiose, and xylose (Figure \ref{fig:sugars_eg}) were released during this trial, and it is likely that the compounded effect of high temepratures and shearing from being in a flowing, fibrous slurry inactivated more enzymes than were intended. Cellulases are highly susceptible to shear \citep{reese1980}. Heat transfer limitations at these solids loadings may have also contributed to poor hydrolysis during the second batch of CC*-CC. The flow loop temperature was set to 65 \degree C at the start of the experiment and dropped to 50 \degree C in preparation for the second batch at $t = 40$ minutes (20 minutes ahead of the second batch addition) to allow for enough time for the whole slurry to cool down to 50 \degree C. It is possible that that was not enough time to cool the slurry down thoroughly, so when an addition was made at $t = 1$ h, parts of the system may have still been at elevated temperatures, inactivating some of the enzymes added during the second batch addition. Trial CC*-CC was done to test potential time- and energy-saving practices for scale-up, but it clearly caused unintended enzyme inactivation. 

As shown in Chapter \ref{ch:end-product}, end products can inhibit liquefaction and saccharification. Therefore, it would seem possible that by removing the ability to release end products (e.g., by inhibiting CBH), liquefaction would be less hindered at the start of the second batch. In this case, at the substrate and enzyme loadings used, glucose did not reach inhibitory concentrations (6 g/L as reported by \citep{andric2010} for different cellulases on Solka-Floc), and thus liquefaction was likely not inhibited by end products. The spike in yield stress seen after the second batch addition in EG$_{en}$-CC and CC*-CC was likely not due to end product inhibition, but rather due to the inactivation of other endo-acting enzymes because of the heat treatment of Celluclast. A liquefaction-only step might be more beneficial under conditions where higher concentrations of glucose and cellobiose are released during early hydrolysis, as in cases where Cellic CTec2 cellulases (Novozymes) were used (Chapters \ref{ch:fed-batch} and \ref{ch:end-product}). Overall, conversion was poor in these trials, not exceeding 6\% after two hours of hydrolysis. This likely occurred because only Celluclast was used; much higher conversion levels were achieved after two hours of hydrolysis when Celluclast is supplemented with Novozyme 188 (Novozymes) (see Chapter \ref{ch:wheat-rheology}), or when Cellic CTec2 was used (see Chapter \ref{ch:end-product}). Concentrations of glucose and cellobiose in all trials did not exceed inhibitory levels (6 g/L of glucose on $\beta$-glucosidase on Solka Floc, for instance \citep{andric2010}), so end product inhibition of saccharification was not a concern at such short hydrolysis times at the low enzyme loadings used. In general, it was best for both saccharification and liquefaction to use a full enzyme mixture under these conditions. With Celluclast at 5 FPU/g-biomass, the concentration of sugars released was so low that liquefaction and saccharification were not end-product inhibited. From a scale-up stand point, it is therefore best to have a full suite of enzymes, at optimal proportions, from the start of hydrolysis.

\section{Conclusion}
A procedure to isolate endoglucanase enzymes in a commercial cellulase mixture in lieu of purification was developed and tested both in assays and in the flow loop in a fed-batch setup. Enzymatic activity assays showed that the endo enhancement procedure was successful in quenching cellobiohydrolase activity while maintaining endoglucanase activity, but assays on other enzymes (e.g., xylanases) are necessary to fully assess how an endo-enhanced enzyme mixture would perform with a cellulosic or lignocellulosic slurry. In fed-batch experiments with cellulosic biomass, a liquefaction pre-hydrolysis step using an endo-enhanced enzyme mixture was not beneficial for overall hydrolysis yields. The endo-enhanced enzymes, however, were successful in emulating the effects of using purified endoglucanases, and could serve as an inexpensive, time-saving alternative for qualitative studies on the effects of endoglucanases in large-scale batch or fed-batch hydrolysis processes. 

%Given the costs of purifying endo-acting enzymes and the hard-to-quantify effect of in-line inactivation of enzymes, it is best to use a full enzyme suite. Removal of products might beenfit some, as products can inhibit liquefaction, but this is not necessary


I would like to thank Nardrapee Karuna for the help with analysis of hydrolyzate samples during these experiments.

Understanding end-product inhibition in high-solids liquefaction of biomass

\section{Abstract}
In high-solids hydrolysis of biomass, liquefaction is a crucial step in lowering suspension viscosity to improve biomass mixability and pumpability. End products of  hydrolysis (e.g., glucose and cellobiose) inhibit saccharification once their concentrations exceed inhibitory levels of cellulases. The effect of end products on liquefaction is, as of yet, unclear. Batch cellulose hydrolysis experiments with added sugars at inhibitory levels (1\% (w/v) glucose, 0.5\% (w/v) cellobiose, and 1\% and 1.5\% (w/v) mannose) were done to better understand end product inhibition effects on both saccharification and liquefaction. Solka-Floc at 8.5\% (w/w) solids was hydrolyzed in a flow loop coupled with real time in-line magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rheological measurements to monitor differences in liquefaction due to sugar treatments. Results showed that end products inhibited both initial saccharification and liquefaction, and that both of these forms of inhibition are worse during the initial stage of hydrolysis when the substrate is highly viscous. No significant differences were observed by 8 hours of hydrolysis, however, since products accumulated regardless of end product treatment, which highlights the need of prompt fermentation or product separation to enable high-solids hydrolysis of biomass.


\section{Background}
The ongoing search for alternative fuels has led significant research toward developing second generation biomass-derived fuels that do not interfere with the world's food supply. Second-generation biofuels undergo a series of processing steps in the conversion from feedstock to ethanol, including pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation, and separation. The hydrolysis step is currently one of the most costly steps in the process \citep{humbird2011}. Hydrolysis at high solids loadings (>15\% (w/w)) is seen as a route to make this process more economically viable \citep{modenbach2013,jorgensen2007}. As the concentration of biomass increases in the cellulosic slurry, however, hydrolysis yields decrease \citep{kristensen2009}. This phenomenon, often termed ``solids effect,'' has been investigated in the past, and has been attributed to a variety of physicochemical features including high viscosity, poor diffusivity and adsorption, low water availability, and end product inhibition \citep{kristensen2009,hodge2008,wang2011}. Isolating the true cause of the ``solids effect'' can be challenging in such a complex system, but could be the key to overcoming the limitation in yields and making hydrolysis a more economically viable process.

At high solids loadings, the higher concentrations of cellulose result in higher concentrations of solubilized products, which means that end products can be one of the biggest inhibitors in the system. Cellobiose and glucose, both products of cellulose hydrolysis by cellulases, are well known inhibitors of cellulases \citep{andric2010}. Therefore, when product concentrations are high, as in high-solids hydrolysis, cellulases are more strongly inhibited if cellobiose and glucose are not fermented or separated from the hydrolyzate. \citet{hodge2008} found sugars to be the primary contributor to lower hydrolysis yields of pretreated corn stover at high solids loadings. Furthermore, \citet{kristensen2009} investigated the effects of end products at different solids loadings, and found end products to be one of the most  significant contributors to the ``solids effect.'' In addition to kinetic inhibition, end products could potentially be one of the biggest contributors to the ``solids effects'' because they may sterically hinder cellulases due to poor mass transport in the cellulose slurry. Due to the low availability of free water, enzymes may have hindered diffusion to reaction sites if mass transport of released products is poor.

%, and the products generated may crowd around unhydrolyzed cellulose, inhibiting further reaction. 

%\todo{Expand based on lit. How is end-product inhibition generally quantified/seen? Is this an early or late phenomenon? Has this been seen before, where no differences appear in the long term? How have high solids papers looked at end products with regard to mass transfer limitations? What have we learned here about enzymatic action? What's new?}

In this work, the effects of end products on liquefaction were investigated. Liquefaction is the initial stage of hydrolysis when fast changes in slurry viscosity occur \citep{szijarto2011}, and fast liquefaction could be the key to enabling high-solids hydrolysis, as the reduction in viscosity would improve convective and diffusive mass transport within the system. Endoglucanases, the primary cellulases that cause a reduction in viscosity \citep{szijarto2011}, can be inhibited by cellobiose and glucose \citep{gruno2004,holtzapple1990}, yet the impact of cellobiose and glucose on liquefaction has previously not been investigated. End product inhibition arose during fed-batch liquefaction experiments (Chapter \ref{ch:fed-batch}) very early during hydrolysis, which resulted in yields not exceeding 50\%. In addition, significant loses in rates of liquefaction from the first batch to subsequent batches were observed, and the cause was unclear. This work will then shed light on whether end products may have caused a loss in liquefaction efficiency due to endoglucanase inhibition. To understand the effects of end products on liquefaction, batch hydrolysis experiments on cellulose were run wherein high concentrations of sugars (glucose, cellobiose, and mannose) were added at the start of hydrolysis. In this manner, the effects of sugars on both short-term (<1 hour) and long-term (8 hours) saccharification and liquefaction were measured.

%This is important from a kinetic modeling process. We still do not have a satisfactory model for high solids hydrolysis that can be used for successful scale-up. At high solids, it may be that hydrolysis is a reaction- and diffusion-limited process (aka the compounding effect) [comment on reaction and diffusion limited stuff from Fogler...]. Previous work [cite egxyl paper] showed that liquefaction and saccharification are decoupled processes in a traditional sense (in our and most exerpiments, they are 2 techniques measuring 2 different enzymes' activities) but those results also suggested that without efficient liquefaction there will not be efficient saccharification. Synergy is important. I hope with these results to shed some light on the extent of synergy between these two major modes of hydrolysis.

\section{Methods}
A magnetic resonance imaging flow loop was set up for hydrolysis experiments as explained in Chapter \ref{ch:methods} and previously demonstrated by \citet{lavenson2011,skovgaard2014,tozzi2014}. The flow rate was set to 15.4 L/min using a positive displacement pump (Moyno, Springfield, OH). Hydrolysis was done at 50 \degree C. An impeller mixer was used in the tank to ensure homogeneity in the mixture.

\subsection{Enzymatic hydrolysis with end product inhibition}
For all experiments, Solka-Floc C100 (International Fiber Corporation, Tonawanda, NY) was used (composition: 71.5\% glucan, 7.1\% xylan, and 5.1\% mannan), at 8.5\% (w/w) total solids loading. Cellic CTec2 (Novozymes, Bagsv{\ae}rd, Denmark) was used at a loading of 5 FPU/g-biomass. The volume of enzyme to be added was calculated based on enzymatic activity from a filter paper unit (FPU) assay \citep{ghose1987}, wherein the activity of the commercial mixture was determined to be 113.6 FPU/ml. All hydrolysis experiments were run for 8 hours, although liquefaction was completed during the first 2 hours of hydrolysis.

At the start of the experiment, 5 L of 50 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, were added to the flow loop and allowed to flow until the buffer reached 50 $\pm$ 1 \degree C. During this buffer warm-up stage, sugars were added at the concentrations shown in Table \ref{table:conc_endprod} for a total of six experimental conditions. A control trial was run with no added sugars.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption[Experimental conditions for end product experiments.]{Experimental conditions for end product experiments. A control trial (1) was run with no added sugars. Trials 2-6 has different concentrations of glucose, cellobiose, or mannose added. Concentrations are on a buffer volume basis.}
\label{table:conc_endprod}
\begin{tabular}{c l c c}
\hline
Trial & Sugar added & Concentration (\%(w/v)) & Concentration (g/L)\\
\hline
1 & None 		& None 		& None\\
2 & Glucose 	& 1.0 \% 	& 10 g/L\\
3 & Cellobiose 	& 0.5 \% 	& 5 g/L\\
4 & Glucose 	& 1.0 \% 	& 10 g/L\\ 
  & Cellobiose 	& 0.5 \% 	& 5 g/L\\
5 & Mannose 	& 1.0 \% 	& 10 g/L\\
6 & Mannose 	& 1.5 \% 	& 15 g/L\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These sugar concentrations were chosen to cause end product inhibition upon the start of hydrolysis. They exceeded inhibitory levels \citep{andric2010} and have previously been used at these concentrations to understand the effects of these sugars on mass transfer \citep{roberts2011}. Mannose was used to test mass transfer limitations, as it is not a primary product of hydrolysis of Solka-Floc (mannan content: 5.1\%), and has been shown to not incur kinetic limitations on the reaction \citep{roberts2011}. Trials 4 and 6 in Table \ref{table:conc_endprod} have the same total sugar concentration, but of different kinds of sugars. This was done to try to decouple kinetic and mass transfer effects on both liquefaction and saccharification.

When the buffer reached reaction temperature, 498.6 g of Solka-Floc were added for a total solids loading of 8.5\% (w/w). The biomass was allowed to hydrate (swell) until the in-line pressure drop measured by the pressure transducer (Branom Instrument Company, Seattle, WA) reached 13.6 $\pm$ 0.1 kPa. At this point, 22.0 ml of CTec 2 were added to start hydrolysis. Samples for off-line analysis were collected every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours, and every 30 minutes for the remaining 6 hours. These samples were subsequently analyzed for sugar contents with High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). 

\subsection{Magnetic Resonance Imaging rheometry}
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) velocimetry coupled with pressure drop measurements were done to measure the changing yield stress of biomass undergoing enzymatic hydrolysis (i.e., liquefaction). A Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo sequence was used, using an Aspect Imaging spectrometer and 1 T magnet with peak gradient strength of 0.3 T/m (Aspect Imaging, Hevel Modi'in Industrial Area, Shoham, Israel). The imaged section of the 0.75 in ID pipe was placed in a radio frequency solenoid coil with 4 turns, 60 mm in diameter and 60 mm long. Slice thickness and field of view (FOV) for these experiments were 50 mm and 30 mm, respectively. Velocity Sweep Width (VSW) and repetition time and echo time (TR and TE, respectively) were adjusted over the course of hydrolysis to maximize signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In general, over the course of liquefaction, TE and TR had to be made longer as the material progressed from solid-like to completely liquefied during 8 hours of hydrolysis.

Yield stresses were measured over the 8 hours of hydrolysis, but liquefaction reached a pseudo steady state within 2 hours of hydrolysis for all trials. To determine the effects of end products on liquefaction, initial rates of liquefaction were calculated by fitting Equation \ref{eqn:liquef} to yield stress data,

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:liquef}
\tau_{0} = a \cdot e^{-b*t} + c,
\end{equation}

where $\tau_{0}$ is the yield stress (Pa), $t$ is the hydrolysis time (h), and $a$ (Pa), $b$ (s), and $c$ (Pa) are fitting constants. All fits were done using nonlinear least squares fitting in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Rates of liquefaction were obtained from the derivative of Equation \ref{eqn:liquef} at time 0, or simply $-a*b$ (Pa/s) (here reported as positive values for ease of comparison). Error bars are from 95\% confidence intervals in fitting.

\subsection{Sugar analysis}
Hydrolyzate samples taken periodically from the flow loop return line were analyzed for soluble sugars by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD). Enzymes were quenched by placing the sample containers in a 90 \degree C water bath for 10 minutes. Samples were then centrifuged and filtered prior to analysis. Separation was carried out on an Aminex HPX-87P column with de-ashing and Carbo-P guard cartridges (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and sugar concentrations were measured by refractive index. The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min at 80 \degree C using nanopure water as the mobile phase. Calibration was performed with standard solutions of \textsc{d}-glucose, \textsc{l}-arabinose, \textsc{d}-xylose, \textsc{d}-mannose, \textsc{d}-galactose and \textsc{d}-cellobiose. Glucan conversion was calculated as per \citet{zhu2011} due to the solids loadings used in these experiments. Detailed calculations were done as shown in Chapter \ref{ch:fed-batch}. 

\subsection{Enzyme viscometric activity assay}
To better understand the mechanism of end product inhibition on liquefaction, a series of viscometric activity assays were run. In a viscometric activity assay, changes in viscosity of a carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, M.W. 800,000, Sigma-Aldrich) solution due to enzymatic hydrolysis are measured \citep{wood1988}. A ten-fold diluted Celluclast sample (Batch NS50013, CCN03132, Novozymes) was placed in a water bath at 65 $\pm$ 1 \degree C for 30 minutes enrich for endoglucanase activity by denaturing exoglucanases in the enzyme mixture (see Chapter \ref{ch:eg}). 
%Endoglucanases are the primary enzymes that cause viscosity changes during hydrolysis \citep{szijarto2011}, and therefore a viscometric activity assay on endoglucanases acting on CMC with added sugars would help determine if inhibitory effects of end products on liquefaction (if any) are a direct effect on the enzymes' active sites. 

For each condition listed in Table \ref{table:conc_endprod}, a 1-hour viscometric assay was run. A 0.5\% (w/v) CMC solution (M.W. 800,000, Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, was prepared. For each trial, the amount of sugar needed to reach the concentrations in Table \ref{table:conc_endprod} in 6 ml of 0.5\% (w/v) CMC was added. 6 ml of CMC solution and 1 ml of enzyme were pipetted  into a Cannon Fenske size 100 viscometer (Cannon Instrument Company, State College, PA) and the viscometer was placed in a 30 \degree C water bath (Haake DC10, Thermo Scientific) so that the parts of the viscometer containing the solution were fully submerged. The efflux time of the CMC and enzyme solution was measured every 10 minutes for 1 hour for each condition. Efflux times were converted to kinematic viscosities by multiplying efflux times by the manufacturer's calibration coefficient (0.015 cSt/s). To determine rates of CMC liquefaction, these data were fit to Equation \ref{eqn:CMCrate},

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:CMCrate}
\nu = a \cdot e^{-b*t} + c,
\end{equation}

where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity (cSt), $t$ is the assay time (s), and $a$ (cSt), $b$ (s), and $c$ (cSt) are fitting constants. All fits were done using nonlinear least squares fitting in MATLAB. The derivative of Equation \ref{eqn:CMCrate} at time 0, $-a*b$ (cSt/s) is the liquefaction rate of CMC.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{End product effects on liquefaction}
%Liquefaction results
Liquefaction of Solka-Floc during hydrolysis, in general, was completed within the first hour of hydrolysis regardless of sugars added initially, as previously observed \citep{tozzi2014,skovgaard2014}, and as indicated by the plateau (i.e., steady state) in yield stress that was observed after 1 hour of hydrolysis (Figure \ref{fig:liquefaction}). 

\begin{figure}[H]

  \label{fig:liquefaction}
\end{figure}

The addition of sugars affected liquefaction rates, especially when both glucose and cellobiose were added (Trial 4, triangles in Figure \ref{fig:liquefaction}), evidenced by the lag in all sugar-added trials in reaching a steady state in yield stress. For instance, the control trial reached steady state in 30 minutes, whereas Trial 4 (glucose and cellobiose added) reached it in approximately 60 minutes. However, not much difference was seen in the yield stress after 8 hours of liquefaction between trials. The enzymes used have no difficulty in liquefying a significant part of the substrate by completion of hydrolysis in spite of delays in reaching steady state. It is possible that the additions of sugars incurred changes that are observable in the microscopic scale, but in the bulk scale (as is the case with these yield stress measurements), no apparent difference was seen with added end products. 

The similarity between treatments in the long run (i.e., after 2 hours of hydrolysis) is promising for scale-up considerations. In a batch setup (as in the cases shown here), no significant differences would appear in terms of energy usage due to the lag in liquefaction if hydrolysis is run through completion of saccharification. In other words, a lag in liquefaction of 30 minutes (as shown here) is not a significant difference if reaching theoretical yields of saccharification takes significantly longer (e.g., 1.5 days for 75\%  conversion \citep{hamelinck2005}). For scale-up, however, a continuous or semi-continuous process might be more desirable. Currently, fed-batch or semi-batch setups are promising for hydrolysis because they allow more substrate to be processed over a given amount of time without incurring mixing and pumping issues inherent of trying to process the same amount of material in a batch process, and in some cases have shown higher yields than batch setups \citep{yang2011,kuhad2010}. In a fed-batch or semi-batch process, however, a lag in liquefaction translates into a lag of each batch addition, which in turn translates to longer reaction times and wasted energy. In other words, the short-term effects of end products on liquefaction would have an impact on a fed-batch process in which each batch occurs in the time scale where this lag is noticeable (e.g., batch duration of <2 hours). This is likely why rates of liquefaction in fed-batch hydrolysis of Solka-Floc decreased significantly between the initial and subsequent batch additions (Figure \ref{fig:liqrates-headloss} in Chapter \ref{ch:fed-batch}).

%\subsubsection{Viscosity as an indicator of mass transfer limitations due to end product inhibition} 
%TO DO: Graph viscosities and conversions as a function of time.
%
%%\todo{the discussion below might already be in thesis intro}
%The inherent non-Newtonian characteristics of biomass at high solids loadings mean that the substrate is highly viscous, which affects overall mass transfer of the different components of the hydrolyzing slurry. The limited availability of free water, especially during early hydrolysis before liquefaction is complete, limits mass transfer and overall reaction efficiency. The time scales for diffusion are much longer than those for hydrolysis [???comparison of $k$'s and time scales? $k_{cat}$ doesn't care about other stuff, this just slows down all the prior $k$'s - find source], especially when the slurry is more viscous. 
%In other words, hydrolysis becomes a diffusion-limited rather than a reaction-limited process.
%
%Prior to liquefaction compleition, mass transfer limitations can manifest themselves in several ways. On a local scale, slower diffusion of cellulases to and from reaction sites, slower diffusion of products released from the substrate away from reaction sites (sterically hindering cellulases from further hydrolysis), and limited adsorption of cellulases onto the substrate [CITE]. On the bulk scale, mass transfer limitations may be caused by poor mixing, which in turn creates a heterogenous slurry that is not fully accessible to the enzymes, and heterogeneous regions will not reach similar extents of hydrolysis as well mixed, homogeneous regions  [CITE LAVENSON 2012, MIXING PAPERS, CAVITY PAPER]. 
%
%In order to understand mass transfer limitations during the 2 hours of liquefaction, apparent viscosity was plotted in FIGURE VISCOSITY with respect to time, as well as extent of hydrolysis. 
%%speculation begins here%
%Apparent viscosity over time highlights how viscosity is reduced over the course of liquefaction, which in turn improves mass transfer within the slurry. 
%Apparent viscosity versus conversion shows how reaction-limited versus diffusion-limited hydrolysis is. The lag in liquefaction with the additions of sugars shows an effect here, where there is a steeper slope when no sugars are added versus when they are.
%
%FIGURE: YIELD STRESS VS. CONVERSION
%
%As per \citet{tozzi2014}, yield stress as a function of conversion is shown here. This highlights the synergy necessary between saccharification and liquefaction for successful hydrolysis. 

\subsubsection{Investigating the mechanism of liquefaction inhibition}
%CMC assay for determining if the effect on liquefaction was on enzymes directly (aka a direct effect on action sites) or a mass transfer effect of the end products crowding out the enzymes due to their proximity to the cellulose and poor mass transfer.

It is evident from Figure \ref{fig:liquefaction} that the addition of sugars affects liquefaction, but further work was needed to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition. End products are known inhibitors of saccharification by cellulases \citep{andric2010,xiao2004}, but it is unclear how they inhibit liquefaction, or, more specifically, endoglucanases, the enzymes that primarily affect viscosity changes during hydrolysis \citep{szijarto2011, skovgaard2014}.  To better understand the mechanism of end product inhibition on liquefaction, a series of viscometric activity assays were run and compared to Solka-Floc liquefaction results. Yield stress versus time data in Figure \ref{fig:liquefaction} were fit to an exponential decay (Equation \ref{eqn:liquef}) to determine rates of liquefaction. These rates are compared to rates of liquefaction of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) in Figure \ref{fig:liqrates}. To understand the effect of sugars on liquefaction, liquefaction rates were normalized with respect to the rate of liquefaction of the control trial of each substrate.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5in]{end-product/liqrates}
  \caption[Comparison of liquefaction of Solka-Floc and CMC with end product inhibition]{Normalized rates of liquefaction of both Solka-Floc (A) and CMC (B) with each end product condition. Rates of liquefaction were normalized with respect to the rate of liquefaction of the control trial with each substrate. Error bars are from 95\% fitting confidence intervals.}
  \label{fig:liqrates}
\end{figure}

%It is worth noting that the numerator in the units of each liquefaction rate are different. For Solka-Floc, ``liquefaction'' refers to changes in yield stress over time, and for CMC, it refers to changes in kinematic viscosity over time. However, each signifies a bulk rheological property that is changing due to enzymatic action, and the purpose of this figure is to represent how rates are changing in the presence of sugar products. Vertical axes were scaled to match rates between control trials so that the effects of the added sugars on liquefaction of Solka Floc versus CMC can be highlighted.

The 0.5\% (w/v) CMC solution used, while viscous, is not difficult to pump and mix, and thus does not cause mass transfer limitations due to low availability of bulk water as in the case of the 8.5\% (w/w) Solka-Floc slurry used. Similarly to the Solka-Floc slurry, however, addition of sugars caused a slowdown in liquefaction of CMC in comparison to the control trial. Furthermore, for both CMC and Solka-Floc, the most pronounced differences in rate of liquefaction occurred when both glucose and cellobiose were added. Cellobiose inhibits endoglucanases \citep{gruno2004}, which would inhibit liquefaction. Glucose can also inhibit endoglucanases indirectly by inhibiting $\beta$-glucosidases and causing an accumulation of cellobiose \citep{holtzapple1990}. For these assays, an endo-enhanced Celluclast mixture was used in order to isolate the effects of end products on endoglucanase from the effects on the full enzyme mixture. Heat treatment of Celluclast to enhance endoglucanase activity, however, had little to no effect on $\beta$-glucosidase activity (see Figures \ref{fig:assay_time}A and \ref{fig:assay_time_CMC}B in Chapter \ref{ch:eg}), and therefore it is likely that, during CMC assays, $\beta$-glucosidases were inhibited by addition of glucose, which resulted in inhibition of endoglucanases (and therefore, liquefaction). 

Mannose affected liquefaction of CMC as well, but not as much as it affected liquefaction of Solka-Floc. On Solka-Floc, mannose (Trials 5 and 6) had an effect on rates of liquefaction on par with glucose and cellobiose (Trials 2 and 3), but not as much as the combination of glucose and cellobiose (Trial 4) (Figure \ref{fig:liqrates}A). On CMC, however, mannose had little effect in comparison with glucose, cellobiose, and their combination (Figure \ref{fig:liqrates}B), since it is not specific to endoglucanases. It appears that liquefaction inhibition due to mannose was of a mass transfer nature (as shown by \citet{roberts2011}), as it had little effect on the more dilute CMC solution. Mannose at high solids loadings (i.e., in the Solka-Floc slurry) inhibited endoglucanases from hydrolyzing and reducing viscosity efficiently. Liquefaction inhibition of Solka-Floc due to glucose and cellobiose, in contrast, seems to be of both a kinetic and mass transfer nature. Glucose and cellobiose inhibited endoglucanases directly when acting on CMC. This inhibition was exacerbated by mass transfer limitations at high solids loadings, which were shown to be present by the effect of mannose on liquefaction of Solka-Floc. Overall, it is apparent that liquefaction inhibition can be caused by end products (e.g., glucose and cellobiose), and this inhibition is worsened at high solids loadings where mass transfer limitations cause sugars to also sterically hinder endoglucanase activity, or to constrain water, leading to decreased diffusivities \citep{roberts2011}.

\subsection{End product effects on saccharification}
Solka-Floc saccharification (i.e., sugar release) with added sugars was mainly inhibited at the start of hydrolysis. Regardless of sugars added, all trials reached glucan conversions of approximately 37-42\%. The lowest extent of hydrolysis was seen when both glucose and cellobiose were added (37.3\%). Figure \ref{fig:conversion} shows extents of glucan conversion over 8 hours of hydrolysis after normalization of glucose and cellobiose concentrations. 
%Conversion
\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{end-product/conversion}
  \caption[Glucan conversion of Solka-Floc with end product inhibition]{Glucan conversion (as \% of theoretical) of Solka-Floc with end product inhibition over 8 hours of hydrolysis. Different symbols indicate different end product treatments, and black circles are from the control trial (i.e., no sugar added). Lines are included to guide the eye.}
  \label{fig:conversion}
\end{figure}

In trials 2, 3, and 4 (the trials in which glucose, cellobiose, or both were added to incur initial end product inhibition), concentrations of glucose and cellobiose (the only sugars included in glucan conversion calculations) were normalized by subtracting the amounts added initially (10 g/L and 5 g/L for glucose and cellobiose, respectively). Furthermore, in trials 3 and 4, in which cellobiose was added, it was clear that the cellobiose added initially was mostly hydrolyzed to glucose by 15 minutes due to the precipitous drops in cellobiose concentrations in those trials after the initial ($t$=0) sample (triangles in Figure \ref{fig:sugar_product}B). Therefore, for those trials, it was assumed that all cellobiose added initially was converted to glucose. Thus, for normalization of trials 3 and 4, the 5 g/L cellobiose added was converted to a glucose equivalent value by multiplying by 1.05 (ratio of molecular weights, i.e., 5 g/L cellobiose is equivalent to 5.26 g/L glucose) and subtracted from the glucose concentration measured by HPLC for all samples except the sample taken at time 0. This resulted in the glucan conversions reported in Figures \ref{fig:conversion} representing substrate conversion only. 

%Individual sugars

   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{end-product/sugars}
  \caption[Glucose and cellobiose concentrations]{Total glucose and cellobiose concentrations for all trials.

Horizontal dashed line (A) indicates inhibitory concentration of glucose as reported by \citet{andric2010}. Lines are included to guide the eye.}
  \label{fig:sugar_product}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:sugar_product} shows total glucose (A) and cellobiose (B) concentrations (not normalized). As shown by data points above the horizontal dashed line in Figure \ref{fig:sugar_product}A, glucose concentrations exceeded inhibitory levels for $\beta$-glucosidases on Solka-Floc ($K_{I}$ of 0.05-6 g/L) \citep{andric2010} within the first 30 minutes of hydrolysis; in the cases where glucose was added at the beginning (trials 2 and 4, empty circles and triangles in Figure \ref{fig:sugar_product}), those concentrations were reached within the first few minutes of hydrolysis. Cellobiose concentrations reached a plateau of 1-2 g/L at approximately 1 hour of hydrolysis,  which matches the point at which glucose release began to slow down. Figure \ref{fig:sugar_product}B also shows that the highest concentrations of cellobiose, and therefore most accumulation, happened when both glucose and cellobiose were added (triangles in Figure \ref{fig:sugar_product}B). It is clear that all trials became inhibited very early during hydrolysis, so that no differences in overall glucan conversion appeared after 8 hours of hydrolysis. In other words, all were inhibited to the same extent by the end of the experiments. 

%\todo{[CALCULATE AND TALK ABOUT INHIBITOR/ENZYME RATIO]}

Since all trials become equally inhibited, it is helpful to compare initial rates of conversion to understand inhibition at early times, when more definite differences in saccharification were seen. The degree of inhibition by end products was quantified by comparing initial glucose release rates of trials with added sugars (Trials 2-6) against the control trial (Trial 1) \citep{xiao2004}. Initial rates were calculated from a linear fit (i.e., $y = a\cdot t+b$) of glucose concentrations versus time from hydrolyzate samples taken during the first 30 minutes of hydrolysis. For trials in which glucose and cellobiose were added, glucose concentrations were first normalized such that glucose released was only considered to be coming from the substrate. Figure \ref{fig:inhibition} shows the extent of inhibition in each trial, represented as $V/V_0$, where $V$ is the initial rate of hydrolysis of each trial and $V_0$ is the initial rate of hydrolysis of the control trial.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{end-product/inhibition}
  \caption[End product inhibition on initial rate of hydrolysis]{End product inhibition in each trial on Solka-Floc, represented as a percentage of inhibition of initial rate of hydrolysis when compared to the control trial (leftmost bar).  Fits were done over 30 minutes of hydrolysis.}
  \label{fig:inhibition}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:inhibition}, a value of 100\% indicates no inhibition; values less than 100\% indicate that saccharification was inhibited and to what extent. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:inhibition}, the addition of end products (glucose and cellobiose) did have an effect on initial rates of hydrolysis, whereas mannose did not (two rightmost bars in Figure \ref{fig:inhibition}. Inhibition due to glucose and cellobiose  is generally due to competitive inhibition \citep{andric2010, asenjo1983}, and this inhibition was exacerbated when these sugars are added at the start of hydrolysis. Therefore, inhibition on saccharification at early times (as in these experiments) was of a kinetic nature, since the presence of mannose did not inhibit glucose release (just as it did not inhibit liquefaction of CMC). Inhibition due to mannose could be attributed to mass transfer effects, e.g., limited diffusion of enzymes due to steric hindrance caused by mannose, but that was not the case under these conditions.

%Mannose did not inhibit saccharification but it did inhibit liquefaction. So liquefaction inhibition could be due to steric hindrance, but not saccharification inhibition.

%\todo{anything with xylose? glucose oxides?}

%%%More speculation below, wait to run HPLC standards
%Transglycosylation is also at play during hydrolysis with CTec2, which contains LPMOs [SPELL], a class of oxidative enzymes [CITE]. There is a steady growth of glucose oxides over the course of hydrolysis and it is possible that some may come from already released glucose, which reduces overall conversion and yield from this substrate of the final, desired product.

%%

Altogether, saccharification was mainly inhibited at early times when glucose and cellobiose were added, but not when mannose was added. Over the 8 hours of hydrolysis, however, similar levels of conversion were achieved, regardless of the treatment used. At the enzyme and substrate loadings used (5 FPU/g-biomass and 8.5\% (w/w) solids), inhibitory levels of glucose are attained within the first hour of hydrolysis. This highlights the need to remove end products to avoid reaching conversion plateaus during hydrolysis, and may be the key to overcoming high-solids effects.

Overall, both saccharification and liquefaction were inhibited in the short term, but achieved similar levels of conversion and liquefaction by the completion of these experiments. From saccharification results, it is clear that inhibitory levels of cellobiose and glucose were reached in all trials during the first hour of hydrolysis. The initial stage of hydrolysis is rate-limiting \citep{lynd2002}; regardless of whether sugars were added or not, the cellulases released sufficient sugars from cellulose during that initial stage to incur limited hydrolysis in the long run. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation or product separation would prevent end product inhibition from affecting batch or semi-batch hydrolysis outcomes.

\section{Conclusion}
A delignified cellulosic substrate was hydrolyzed under various end product inhibition conditions to investigate the impact of added sugars on liquefaction and saccharification. Addition of end products delayed liquefaction and inhibited initial saccharification during the first hour of hydrolysis, but showed no significant difference in yield stress or glucan conversion by 8 hours of hydrolysis. End products affected hydrolysis mainly during the initial stage when the cellulosic slurry was more viscous, which  indicated that end product inhibition is both of a kinetic (competitive) and a mass transfer nature, potentially limiting diffusion and adsorption of cellulases. Overall, the short-term effects shown here would mainly impact continuous and semi-continuous hydrolysis processes (which are desirable for scale-up of hydrolysis due to economic considerations), and they highlight the need to remove or ferment sugars in the hydrolyzate in order to not lose efficiency in a continuous process.

Characterization of diffusivity of Cel7A in a cellulosic fiber bed

\section{Abstract}
The goal of this work was to measure diffusivity and adsorption of \textit{Tr}Cel7A  cellulase in cellulosic fibers. Experiments were not completed, but this chapter lays the groundwork for labeling enzymes, which is needed if this is to be performed under MRI. 

\section{Background}
Scale-up of high solids hydrolysis (for economic reasons) requires a deep udnerstanding of the kinetics. Significant work has gone into understanding the kinetics of hydrolsis from an empirical and a mechanistic standpoint (see Introduction -- Kinetics). This is tackled at low loadings of both enzymes and biomass, so as to not run into saturation issues. At high solids however, a host of new issues are introduced \citep{hodge2008,kristensen2009}. In hihg solids hydrolysis of biomass, one of the inhibitors under the umbrella of ``high solids effects'' are mass transfer effects. In fact, most issues can be attributed to this. At high solids loadings of biomass ($>$ 15 \% (w/w)), water is not as readily available in the bulk, the suspension is non-Newtonian, and therefore really difficult to pump and mix \citep{lavenson2011,roche2009}. Because you can't mix, maintaining homogeneity in the reactor is limited to diffusive processes, and these are also limited when most of the suspension is a solid [CITE]. Diffusion and adsoprtion are crucial steps in the hydrolysis kinetics of this heterogeneous system [CITE]. First of all, cellulases need to diffuse to reaction sites, to the accesible surface areas so they can cleave glycosidic bonds. From there, they adsorb onto the substrate, or diffuse along the surface. Once cleavage happens, those products (e.g., glucose, cellobiose) need to diffuse away from the susbtrate so as to not sterically hinder the cellulases from further hydrolysis [CITE SOURCE FOR ALL THESE STEPS]. If any of these mass transfer processes become limited, a bottleneck results. This is particularly important during early hydrolysis at high solids before liquefaction takes place, which can improve the mixability of the suspension [CITE]. Hydrolysis is at its fastest at the beginning; limiting that could results in long-term slowdown [CITE]. Some models exist that try to quantify this mass transfer, but so far it has not been successfully measured. Kinetic models don't seem to work very well at high solids due to all the confounding effects happening. Therefore the goal of this work was to directly measure some of these mass transfer steps to help validate models at high solids and get closer to creating a kientic model that works not only at low loadings, but also at high loadings that incorporates mass transfer limitations. Understanding mass transfer limitations might also be the key to overcoming them.

The goal of this work was to measure diffusivities and adsorption of cellulases in cellulosic fiber beds at different solids loadgins and enzyme concentrations to effectively characterize mass transfer of cellulases, which in the past has only been done at low loadings [CITE, AND UPDATE].

A lot of kinetic models include diffusivity to characterize kinetics \citep{luterbacher2012} [CITE]. While this work may only characterize effective diffusivities due to the confounding variables involed in measuring diffusivity in porous fibers , it may shed light on some of the mass transfer problems that arise during early hydrolysis. This, in essence, is a fundamental study at high solids, and the hope is that when sotnrasting it to the extensive work at lower loadings, it could highlight the key issues to voercome, and parameters to know, when doing hydorlysis at high solids. 

To measure diffusivities at high solids, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is probably the ebst technique. At high solids, celluloci fibers form an opaque bed, making it hard to use optical techniques (fluorescence microscopy, confocal miscorpcopy). FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) is another popular technique for measuring diffucivity [CITE] but it is aimed at measuring self diffusivities, which would not work in this case. It might be useful however, to measure self diffusivity of Cel7A in order to compare it to what happens in high solids and elucidate the variables that arise then, but it's not great for the purposes of this study. In the past, MRI has been used effectively to measure diffusivities of contrast agents \citep{tozzi2012} and BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin, a protein) \citep{lavenson2012,roberts2011} in cellulosic fibers, making it a great candidate for measuring diffusivities of Cel7A. With a system set up with a relatively simple geomtry as shown before \citep{tozzi2012, lavenson2012, roberts2011}, MRI would be successful regardless of the concentration of fibers or enzymes used. 

MRI relies on the differences between magnetic moments of nuclei in different parts of the imaged system \citep{choi2002} and is therefore independent of optical properties of the system. The key to imaging with MRI is to just be able to tell the enzymes apart from the fibers with the use of a contrast agent and/or a sequence that highlights these differences. In these past studies they used MnCl2 and Gd-BSA; both Mn and Gd are paramagnetic contrast agents, emaning that in the presence of a magnetic field they have a dipole moment, and this dipole moment affects the relaxation times of nearby protons. Gd is often used as an imaging tracer in blood [CITE]. In the case of the stuydies above, with the sequences they used, regions within the sample where these contrast agents were present had a hgiher signal intensity. The thing about MRI, with the reslution it has, it generally only shows the contrast of a general area, not individual molecules (enzyme size XXX, resolution of MRI XXX). For that reason, it's important to set up a simple enough geometry so that concentrations of tracked molecules can be measured and modeled (e.g., using Fick's law).

GdBSA is of particular interest and relevance to measuring the diffusivity of cellulases. At XXX in diameter, it's a mostly spherical protein [CITE], whose radius approximates the hydrodynamic radius of Cel7A, the most representative of all cellulases due to the composition of commercial cocktails [CITE]. Cel7A however, has two domains and a non-spherical gemoetry [CITE: Beckham] that means that approximating its diffusivity with a hydrodynamic radius may not be necessarily representative of the enzyme. In the studies done \citep{lavenson2012, roberts2011}, BSA also did not adsorb onto the cellulosic fibers, which would confound its diffusivity. Cel7A, on the other hand, adsorbs and hydrolyzes cellulsoe [CITE], so isolating diffusivity becomes more challenging, and modeling chnages in concentration throughout a fiber bed would require a more complex mass transport model that also accounts for adsorption and reaction kinetics. 

A first step in measuring mass transport of Cel7A via MRI is to, for example, label it with a tracer so that it can be contrasted with everything else in the system. As in \citet{roberts2011}, T1 contrast imaging could be done, which would require different parts of the system to have significantly different T1s. Labelign Cel7A with Gd would be promising, as a similar experiment as \citet{roberts 2011} and  \citet{lavenson2012} could be set up.

While it owuld be ideal to emasure diffusivities of all cellulases, a good start is Cel7A, as it is the most representative enzyme (by fraction composition) of commercial cellulcas cocktails [CITE]. Cel7A is a cellobiohydrolase, which makes up the bulk of commercial mixtures, and are cellulases that cleave cellobiose from the insoluble substrate. One possible route to labeling enzymes is using the same chemistry as when labeling with fluorophores [CITE].  This idea was used in thos work to try to label Cel7A with Gd-DOTA, a common MRI tracer for blood flow imaging [CITE]. Cel7A in particular has 10 lysine groups [CITE] that can be conjugated to form an amide with an NHS ester, that can then bind to DOTA. DOTA is a chelator with the structure shown in Figure \ref{fig:dota} that can then hold a Gd3+ ion in a stable bond [CITE]. This would allow for Cel7A, once labeled with Gd-DOTA, to be tracked with MRI and T1(?)-weighted imaging.

\end{figure}

Overall, the goal of this work was to measure diffusivities of Cel7A in different fiber beds comprised of various concentratins of substrates, with different compositions. To achieve this goal, the steps were and would be,

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Purification and labeling of Cel7A}: Cel7A needs to be isolated from an enzyme mixture through a series of separation steps. Once isolated, it needs to be labeled with an MRI tracer for contrast imaging. Labeling of Cel7A with a paramagnetic tracer has not been done before as far as I know, so a labeling procedure needs to be developed.

\item \textit{Characterization of degree of labeling}: Once a mtheod for labeling is developed, repeated experiments need to be done to determine the degree of labeling on a concnetration and on a per enzyme basis. In other words, given a concnetration of enzymes that undergoes the labeling procedure, how many end up labeled? How many labels are attached to each enzyme?

\item \textit{MRI method development}: Prior to doing experiments with the enzymes, the MRI procedure needs to be developed and standardized. An imaging sequence that allows for Gd/T1 contrast needs to be used, and the best parameters for highest contrast between different concentration regions needs to be developed in both aqueous solutions and in a cellulosic fiber beds. Additionally, a geometry for initial and boundary conditions needs to be developed so that all trials start similarly.

\item \textit{MRI concentration calibration}: With the gemoetry of the setup and the sequence determined, the next step would be to do some trial experiments with a concnetration gradient (of, for example, gadolinium chloride GdCl3 and also with Gd-Cel7A). Using MATLAB, write a script to analyze the data, and determine calibration curves of concentration vs. signal intensity. consistently correlating signal intensity with concentration.

\item \textit{Diffusion experiments}: Once the method for experiments and the analysis tools are in place, begin diffusion experiments. Do the necessary number of replicates for a double factorial (?) experiment, at 3 levels of enzyme concentration and 3 levels of substrate concentration. Repeat with Solka-Floc C100 and 200EZ, pretreated corn stover. Perform experiments over the course of a week per trial, or until concentration looks uniform through the sample. Maintain samples at 4 \degree C to minimize hydrolysis.

\item \textit{Model determination and data fitting}: Once all the images are obtained, proceed with analysis. For each trial there will be a concentration profile across the sample for each time point. Given that and the initial and boundary conditions, find a diffusion or diffusion-reaction model that fits well to determine effective diffusivities for each trial.

\item \textit{Diffusion modeling}: If possible, model diffusion as a function of substrate characteristics, and enzyme and substrate loadings. Apply this model to kinetic models that account for diffusion. The validity of both kinetic and mass transfer models can then be determined on a real system.

\end{enumerate}

The steps done are decribed in more detail in Materials and Methods. The other steps are for directions of future work.

The work presented here comprises the first three steps listed. Methods and results shown below are included as sort of ``best practices'' for future  attempts at measuring effecitve diffusivities of cellulases at high solids loadings. Possible directions of future work are also included.


\section{Methods}
\subsection{Purification of Cel7A}
\textit{Trichoderma reesei} Cel7A was isolated from Celluclast (Novozymes...) by buffer exchange, resource Q, anion exchange chromatogrpahy, pAPC, and size exclusion column, as described by [CITE AND CLEAN UP] (AKTA, GE). Final concentrations of purified enzymes were determined by Bradford assay of protein concentration (XXX). To determine that Cel7A was successfully isolated, protein gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, Bio-Rad...) was performed against a previously purfied sample and full mixture.

\subsection{Labeling of Cel7A}
Two different techniques were attempted to label Cel7A: one method involved conjugation of DOTA (D...O...T...A...) onto Cel7A followed by chelation by Gd, and the other method involed a labeling kit purchased from BioPal (XXX). Both techniques used similar steps.
After purification, Cel7A was in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer and 100 mM sodium chloride. A buffer exchange was performed, wherein 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate was added to the enzyme solution, centrifuged and filtered (XXX) a 2-3 times to perform a buffer exchange to a more basic buffer to reduce the presence of nucleophiles. The buffer exchange enzures that the NHS-ester (or other) will bind to the enzyme, and not compete with water (?).

\subsubsection{Labeling with conjugation with Gd-DOTA}
After buffer exchange, the enzymes were conjuagted with DOTA NHS-ester (Macrocyclics...) by mixing end-over-end (?) for XX hours. After XX hours, the conjugated enzymes were chelated with 10x excess gadolinium chloride salt (MANUFACTURER) by mixing end-over-end at room temperature overnight.

[ADD CONCENTRATIONS USED -- LOOK AT LAB NOTEBOOK]
After chelation, the excess gadolinium salt was removed by desalting with small Desalt columns (XXX) with a buffer exchange to 50 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0. This is the premise of the labeling chemistry.

\subsubsection{Labeling with BioPal labeling kit}
After the buffer exchnage to the basic buffer, the reagents in the BioPal kit (MODEL, BioPal, XXX) were mixed as instructed by manufacturer and added to the enzymes and allowed to mix for XX hours. To remove excess gadolinium salt, a desalting column (HiPrep Desalting. AKTA system, GE Healthcare) was used. The 2ml sample holding loop was used, and the protocol involved loading of 2 contorl volumes, injection, and loading of 2 more contorl volumes, waiting for breakthrough in the chromatogram that indicated Cel7A was separated from the rest. A 50 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0 was used for this procedure.

Aliquots (200 $\mu$l) of the final labeled solution were placed in wells in a 96-well plate and its absorbance at $\lambda$ of 280 nm was read to determine the presence of enzyme. 
In the case of the kit-labeled enzyme sample, a pNPL assay for cellobiohydrolase activity [CITE] was performed against a control (unlabeled) sample to determine if Cel7A activity was still present after labeling. Additionally, SDS-PAGE was run to accurately determine, by molecular weight (?), if Cel7A was still present in the final labeled solution, since the NHS-ester (or DOTA?) also absorbs at 280 nm.


\subsection{MRI method development} 
Once the presence and acitivty of Cel7A are confirmed, the next step was to determine if it was successfully labeled for MRI contrast imaging. Several samples were prepared and imaged with a Spin Echo (?) sequence with [PARAMETERS], as well as NMR relaxometry measurements. For all MRI experiments, a 1 T magnet with a peak gradient strength of 0.3 T/m (Aspect Imaging, ...) and a 60 mm coil that enclosed the imaged volume, 60 mm long and 60 mm in diameter was used. The samples tested were: sodium acetate buffer blank, unlabeled Cel7A, labeled Cel7A, and XX M GdCl3.

For relaxometry measurements, each sample's T1 and T2 relaxation times were obtained. Relaxation times were expected to be significantly shorter for labeled samples (i.e., samples containing Gd). A full microcentrifugre tube was placed in the NMR sample holder for each measurement. T1 saturation recovery and T2 CPMG (Carr-Purcell- -McGill) sequences were used for these measurements. T1 and T2 relaxation times also gave startiing parameters for the Spin Echo  (?) sequence used.

In order to perform diffusion experiments, signal intensity in a sample needs to be correlated to concentration in order to obtain a model concentraiton profile for a each sample at every timepoint. In the sample holder in the 60 mm coil [NUMBER OF TURNS], one side held a microcentrifuge tube of water, and the other held a microcentrifugre tube full of sample.  By imaging simulataneously wityh water, the signal intensity could be normalzied and compared between samples. Successful labeling would result in high contrast in the case of the labeled enzyme that is similar to that of the gadolinium chloride sample. The buffer and unlabeled Cel7A samples should have signal intensities similar to that of water. 

\subsection{Characterization of degree of labeling} 
pNPL and SDS-PAGE were done to confirm the presence and acitivty of Cel7A, and NMRI measurements were to confirm labeling. To determine the extent of labeling (i.e., number of labels per enzyme), first the concentration of enzyme present in the labeled sample was determined with a Bradford protein concnetration assay (XXX) against a known concentration of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Then a series of GdCl3 concentrations (down to 10,000-fold dilution from added) are imaged against water to obtain a concentration versus signal intensity curve for GdCl3, and a similar curve is obtained for Gd-Cel7A by again doing serial dilutions of the enzyme in water. If those curves end up being similar, then GdCl3 curve will be the standard to compare against in future experiments. Knowing the concentration of Gd and the concnetration of enzymes in a sample will then give a rough estimate of the degree of labeling of each sample. This characterizaiton needs to be done with each new batch of labeled enzyme to ensure reproducibility and to be able to back out enzyme concentration based on the Gd signal intensity/contrast. Similar concentration vs. signal intensity correlaitons have been used and shown previously \citep{tozzi2012,lavenson2012, roberts2011}.


\section{Results}
\subsection{Labeling}
Initial attempts at labeling with NHS-ester and Gd-DOTA were unsuccessful. Despite trying to change the buffer pH so that esters would more readily conjugate the enzymes (Ka?), it was not successful in getting labels on the enzymes. Fundamentally, the chemistry was there, but this was not successful.

With the labeling kit, results were better, and this was used for MRI trials.

GdCl3 concentrations were used to obtain a curve. Here's an example figure, and what its analysis looked like.

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Isolation of variables}
This lays a good foundation for this work. The enxt step is to measure diffusivities with the lbaeling method in place and the MRI method established.

\subsection{Directions of future work}
If all goes, well, one could attempt adsorption studies with these labeled enzymes [INCLUDE PROPOSAL ADSORPTION STUFF...]
With adsorption and diffusion data well characterized, the mass transfer at high solids would be well characterized. Then the next step could be determining at what length scale is mass transport no longer an issue.




Conclusions
In general, there are two major approaches to improve the process economics of this step: (1) with an in-depth understanding and model development of the hydrolysis kinetics to drive reactor design under optimal conditions, and (2) with process modifications to understand, from a practical standpoint, how different variables may affect the extent of hydrolysis and process efficiency.
\section{Final comments}
In this dissertation, experimental work to characterize the rheology of cellulosic slurries during hydrolysis and liquefaction was presented. Initial characterization work led to the development of a process that uses the slurry's yield stress as a process control variable. Given the goal to scale up the production of second-generation biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass, this work is practical and essential in understanding how bulk-scale rheological properties are changing and what those changes imply for a process. Economic considerations require the hydrolysis step to be done at high solids loadings, at which point the slurry is highly viscous and non-Newtonian, and can incur conversion and processing challenges. An understanding of this behavior and what makes biomass leave this regime during hydrolysis could result in more energy-efficient processes. 

Enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were done on lignocellulosic and delignified cellulosic biomass in batch and fed-batch modes, with a variety of enzymatic treatments, to understand major trends that arise during biomass liquefaction and saccharification. Liquefaction was monitored with \textit{in situ}, real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements, and saccharification was measured with off-line High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) measurements. In some studies, fiber length and moisture content measurements were also done to understand how they are changing due to hydrolysis. MRI provides flow velocity information that, when coupled with in-line pressure drop measurements, provides rheological information on a fluid. It is an apt technique for biomass due to biomass' turbidity, high concentrations, and large particle sizes, as well as its water absorption capacity (which can be susceptible to squeezing in off-line rheometry). Initial batch studies on wheat straw showed that the mechanisms of liquefaction and saccharification are decoupled, as liquefaction (which was consistently fast in all experiments performed) did not necessarily entail efficient saccharification. As defined, both occurred due to different modes of enzymatic activity, as liquefaction (changes in viscosity) occurred mainly due to depolymerization of cellulose chains into oligomers and fiber shortening by endoglucanases, and saccharification was characterized by cellobiose and glucose release primarily from cellobiohydrolase and $\beta$-glucosidase activity. Xylanases were also found to impact both liquefaction and saccharification of wheat straw, and therefore aided in lignocellulose hydrolysis. Extents and rates of liquefaction and saccharification were also affected by enzymatic treatment and temperature, highlighting the need to optimize operating conditions for the substrate in use. MRI velocity profiles also showed the appearance of a transient, annular flow profile during wheat straw liquefaction otherwise not present during Solka-Floc liquefaction. Such profiles could indicate a radial concentration gradient of fibers within the pipe, as well as fiber flocculation, which affect how fibers interact with one another, and may impact accessibility of enzymes to cellulose. In addition, annular flow profiles could indicate the presence of a water viscous layer, which may aid in lubricating the flow of concentrated biomass suspensions. Understanding annular profiles during liquefaction could shed light on morphological changes in fibers and their flow behavior, which is important for scale-up considerations. These batch experiments highlighted important trends in liquefaction, such as its fast rate (in relation to saccharification) regardless of process conditions, which could be used for process design wherein energy consumption needs to be reduced.

%fed batch, eg, end product chapters here
Following initial batch experiments, the next studies involved designing and improving a hydrolysis process for operation at high solids loadings that exploits (1) how fast liquefaction occurs regardless of conditions, and (2) the fact that MRI provides near real-time data on the progress of liquefaction. This led to the development (and patenting) of a data-driven process. In this process, yield stress was monitored in real time during hydrolysis of delignified cellulose using MRI. By simply monitoring when liquefaction reached steady state, and performing batch additions at that point, a more energy-efficient process was run. A similar process would be desirable for scale-up of hydrolysis because it operates similarly independent of the substrate or enzymes used, and relies on process-dependent data. This fed-batch process also allowed to readily operate in the high-solids regime, as solids were over doubled in all trials in just 12 hours of hydrolysis. Similar loadings would not have been achievable with the setup used for these experiments in batch mode. Additionally, the energy efficiency and liquefaction efficiency were further improved by changing the mode of enzyme addition; adding all enzymes initially, due to the initial boost in conversion and liquefaction, resulted in an aggregated improvement over the 12 hours of hydrolysis. That the mode of enzyme additions can significantly impact process yields presents opportunities for further improvement of this process. However, this process, although good for attaining high solids, was ultimately limited by end product inhibition. This highlighted the need for separation or fermentation of hydrolysis products.

Initial fed-batch studies led to further attempts at improving the hydrolysis process and understanding the impact of end products on liquefaction, which were inhibitory in fed-batch experiments. One potential route for improvement was to understand how a liquefaction-only batch would affect subsequent hydrolysis. Pre-hydrolysis liquefaction steps are commonly used to significantly lower the apparent viscosity of the biomass slurry prior to hydrolysis. A fed-batch experiment was set up wherein the first batch was either done with isolated endoglucanases or a full enzyme mixture. To work at the flow loop loadings (reactor size of approximately 10 kg), purification of endoglucanases for a liquefaction-only batch would have been cumbersome and with low yield; an endo-enhanced enzyme mixture was used in lieu of purification of endoglucanases. A process was developed wherein, due to the different thermostabilities of different enzymes, heat treatment of a mixture led to quenching of cellobiohydrolases and enhancement of endoglucanases. The effect of this heat treatment on other enzymes (e.g., xylanases) is yet to be quantified. This endo-enhanced mixture was a useful tool in assessing, qualitatively, the performance of endoglucanases alone at flow loop scales, and is thus a low-cost, practical tool for preliminary assessments. In the fed-batch experiments, it was found that a liquefaction-only step did not impact hydrolysis yields in a subsequent batch. Product concentrations at the enzyme loadings used were not enough to incur end product inhibition, which is probably why no difference was seen. Overall, a similar enzyme addition setup could be used to improve similar fed-batch processes.

Lastly, in fed-batch experiments, end products ultimately limited conversion; thus the effect end products have on liquefaction, especially at high solids loadings, was studied.  In trials with sugars added, especially when both glucose and cellobiose were added, both initial rates of saccharificaitron and liquefaction were affected, but no discernible difference was seen in the long term. This was likely due to the fact that, under the conditions tested, inhibitory levels of end products were attained early in hydrolysis, resulting in similar long-term effects in all trials. The short-term differences (during the first hour of hydrolysis), however, will have an impact in processes where changes are occurring in much shorter time scales, i.e., during semi-batch, fed-batch, or continuous processes. In those cases, the short-term effects may be compounded over time. This is likely why fed-batch experiments saw a significant loss in liquefaction rates between the first batch and subsequent batches. Results showed that end products are some of the primary causes of the ``solids effects'' (decrease in conversion with increase in solids content). End products are known inhibitors of cellulases, but they might also be creating steric limitations on hydrolysis, which is exacerbated at high solids loadings, when the concentrations of products are much higher and mass transport is highly limited due to the lack of bulk water. Again, these limitations could be overcome by fermenting products or product separation. 

%In general, in batch experiments, end product concentrations may not reach inhibitory levels until liquefaction is complete (because it is so fast in relation to saccharification), and therefore they are likely not going to have an effect in th elong term, as was seen in these studies with added glucose, cellobiose, and mannose.

Overall, these studies highlighted important rheological features of liquefaction and factors that could be rate-limiting in a scaled-up process. Efficient liquefaction could be key to overcoming solids effects, as it lowers the bulk viscosity of the cellulosic slurry and releases absorbed water, which eases mixing. Improved handling, in turn, facilitates bulk mass transport. A fed-batch process centered on liquefaction could be one pathway to high-solids processing, keeping in mind the removal of end products to avoid conversion and liquefaction limitations in the long term. These features are important for economically viable scale-up of hydrolysis, as they will help optimize liquefaction of this process, potentially reducing the costs of this step in a biorefinery setting.

\section{Directions of future work}
% Expand on what's next for my experiments
The work in this dissertation was done to understand liquefaction during biomass hydrolysis, and this was done in real time with magnetic resonance imaging rheometry. Initial assessments showed a decoupled relationship between liquefaction and saccharification. However, further work and insight showed that the relationship between liquefaction and saccharification is not strictly decoupled, and that understanding it might be key to empirical modeling of this process in a way that is relevant for scale-up. As defined, these processes are considered decoupled because, on the one hand, liquefaction is measured by a bulk-scale property (i.e., changes in viscosity or yield stress) that at the local scale likely is characterized by oligosaccharides released. Saccharification, on the other hand, is only quantified by the glucose and cellobiose concentrations in the hydrolyzate.  A step toward a more complete model that encompasses the synergy between liquefaction and saccharification would be to measure the concentration and chain lengths of oligosaccharides released, to quantify the changes in degree of polymerization of cellulose, and to correlate those concentrations and changes to viscosity changes. This will result in comparison of similar properties and potentially an empirical yet mechanistic model that correlates liquefaction and saccharification.  Hydrolysis is, in essence, a depolymerization reaction, and understanding the intrinsic mechanism by which enzymes depolymerize cellulose will be essential for modeling this process.  Kinetic models that include substrate considerations (e.g., lignin and hemicellulose content, crystallinity, porosity)  can then be validated with a variety of substrates in order to build a model of hydrolysis that encompasses the complexity of this system. 
%It is possible that similar concentrations of oligos and mono/disaccharides are released (i.e., same number of bonds broken in a siungle hydrolysis event with an enzyme mixture), but looking at liquefaction in terms of viscosity/yield stress does not shed light on this. Different enzymes cleave cellulose in different ways, and are highly specific at doing so. This can be done by udnerstanding the intermediary depolymerization steps (i.e., chain populations obtained from oligosaccharide measurements). This will provide mechanistic insight to validate the models that take a mechanistic approach at modeling hydrolysis. But validating mechanistic models with oligosaccharide data is necessary for a fundamental model of hydrolysis that can then be made more complex with substrate considerations. To build a universal model, a global model of hydrolysis for reactor dsign, we have to start there. This is key for scale-up. A lot of kinetic models are currently out there, and some of the most promising one that acocunt for substrate changes and the mechanistic steps that cellulases take, are purely models and computationally demanding. The first stpe toward validation is to test these models out in a real system and see how they perform. And match each ``guessed'' parameter with a real variable. Mass transport will determine how any reator design will work, and is ultimately the gate-keeper for efficient hydrolysis. Some initial attempts by me proved unsuccessful in labeling Cel7A for MRI measruements, but the biochemistry is there and it is doable with mroe time. 

In addition to modeling and validation of liquefaction, further insight into mass transfer mechanisms of different cellulases is still needed to correlate kinetics with mass transport, which is a rate-limiting process at high solids loadings. For example, in this work, the limitations due to end products were speculated to be of a mass transfer nature at high solids, but a more fundamental understanding and diffusivity and adsorption measurements would be needed to corroborate these speculations. One way to quantify the effect of end products on mass transfer could be by measuring the diffusion and adsorption of cellulases in cellulosic suspensions. MRI has been used in the past to measure adsorption and diffusivity of bovine serum albumin (a protein) in concentrated cellulosic suspensions, and it is likely that a similar experimental setup could be used to do the same with cellulases. My initial attempts at labeling Cel7A with a paramagnetic tracer for this purpose proved unsuccessful, but further research into the biochemistry of labeling cellulases could lead to a viable probe for diffusivity and adsorption of these enzymes. Enzyme accessibility to cellulose is the initial rate-limiting factor during hydrolysis, and diffusion and adsortpion could be seen as direct measures of how the enzymes will approach the accessible surface area. These measurements could be used to improve and validate kinetic models. 

%Overall, the work presented here was mainly empirical. 
The key for commercialization of second-generation biofuels is having a viable process, and hydrolysis will remain the most expensive step in the process unless a global kinetic model of hydrolysis exists that can be used for reactor design and optimization. Empirical work to understand phenomena, such as the work shown here, is helpful in determining which features of this highly heterogeneous system truly affect hydrolysis outcomes. Further work is needed to correlate the results shown here to models, and to ultimately proceed to reactor design and process optimization on a large scale. Work in this area will continue as we try to meet renewable energy needs and mandates, and establishing a process that is scalable, optimizable, and valid for all sources of biomass and enzymes would be necessary to design an economically viable process, and for that we will need reliable global models of each step of the biorefining process. Currently research is under way to understand and predict phenomena at every size scale of this process. With the first cellulosic biofuel plants starting operations in the United States last year and continued research on process modeling and improvement, I am confident that we will meet these alternative energy goals.



Complementary studies: Hybrid Methods for Profiling Viscometry of Complex Fluids

In this work, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and pulse Ultrasound Doppler Velocimetry (UDV) were used to measure velocity profiles in a horizontal pipe of water, an aqueous xanthan gum solution, and fiber suspensions. The goal of this work was to fully measure velocity profiles of these fluids, with well-characterized profiles from the near-wall region (microns near the wall) to the bulk region by combining methods that have been proven successful in characterizing each individual region (boundary layer region, bulk region).


\subsection{Velocity Measurement Techniques for Profiling Viscometry}

\subsubsection{Ultrasound Doppler Velocimetry}
Ultrasound Doppler Velocimetry (UDV) is a  relatively simple, non-intrusive acoustic measurement technique. In the literature, the terms ultrasound velocity profiling (UVP) and ultrasound pulse doppler (UPD) refer to variations of this technique and measurement method. The origin of UDV dates three decades back in the medical field where it was applied to measure blood flow. UDV is based on using an emitter-receiver probe to send a series of short ultrasound bursts into the flow, and detecting the echoes issuing from the target particles moving along with the flow. The spatial location of the particles is acquired with the time-of-flight method using the known velocity of sound in the flowing medium,
\begin{equation}
d=c\tau/2, 
\end{equation}
%\todo{add units to variables}
where $\tau$ (s) is the time interval between transmitting and receiving the ultrasound signal, $d$ is the distance (m), and $c$ is the speed of sound (m/s).
The velocity at a given position is a function of the Doppler shift frequency $f_{D}$ and speed of sound $c$ in the sample through the following relationship,
\begin{equation}
v=(cf_{D})/(2*f_{0}*cos(\theta)),
\end{equation}
where $f_{0}$ is the ultrasound emitter frequency and $\theta$ is the Doppler angle. The Doppler angle is defined as the complement of the angle of inclination of the ultrasound beam and the direction of the main velocity vector of the moving target particles (pipe wall). Thus, UDV measures the velocity component in the direction of the ultrasound beam. The cross-section of measurement volume, in which the velocity is acquired, can be considered as disk-shaped with effective dimensions determined by the probe's piezoelectric element generating the ultrasonic pulse train. The diameter and shape of the measurement volume changes along the measurement axis as the ultrasound beam diverges. The thickness of the measurement volume is determined by the number of the cycles within the ultrasonic pulses as,
\begin{equation}
v=(c*N)/(2*f_{0})
\end{equation}.  
For example, the length of an ultrasound pulse with a frequency of 4 MHz and a length of 2 cycles correspond to a physical length of ~0.375 mm in water.

If the ultrasound travels through e.g. a pipe wall, the initial angle changes according to the law of refraction. The determination of the spatial locations can be corrected knowing the properties and dimensions of the acoustic coupling and wall material. In practice, the velocity of the target particles is calculated from the cross-correlation between the echoes from the emitted pulse train.  

\subsubsection{Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging}
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a technique that uses the interaction between magnetic moments in the nuclei of a sample and an applied external magnetic field to obtain structural, spatial, and translational molecular data \citep{choi2002}. During an NMR experiment, a sample is placed within a magnetic field, enclosed by a radio frquency (RF) probe. A current is sent through the probe, creating a magnetic pulse that affects the nuclei in the sample depending on the frequency used. The signal obtained from the precession and relaxation of these nuclei to their original state is acquired; these relaxation times can be used to characterize different aspects of a sample. For these experiments, all samples are in the liquid state, and we targeted the most abundant nucleus in the aqueous samples, \ce{^{1}H}. When characterizing flow, NMR can exploit flow artifacts in static measurements to obtain flow behavior \citep{budinger1988}. When the sample is flowing, the displacement of the nuclei during the imaging time is used to determine flow velocity \citep{choi2002}. To obtain velocity information for a fluid at steady state (in the time scale of image acquisition), steady state recovery, time of flight, or phase shift methods can be used \citep{callaghan2011}. This work will focus on a phase shift method carried out by the Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) sequence, where a spin-echo sequence is coupled with magnetic pulse gradients to better resolve velocity profiles. With PGSE, gradients are introduced in both the frequency encoding and phase encoding directions to allow for two- or three-dimensional spatial resolution of velocity profiles. In other words, the frequency and phase shift of the nuclei precessing back to the initial magnetization as they flow can be detected with high precision to obtain radial and velocity information for the targeted nuclei \citep{li1992}. Due to the gradients applied, spins in a sample carry frequency and phase shift information that can be acquired with high precision, and thereafter transformed into spatial and velocity information upon processing.

\subsubsection{Optical Coherence Tomography}
The spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), used in this work, is a fusion of laser Doppler velocimetry and optical coherence tomography. In the SD-OCT, a light beam of low coherence is emitted from a super luminescent led light source and split into the sample arm and the reference arm of the Michelson interferometer. The backscattered interference pattern carries information about the sample scattering index from different depths inside the sample. Two-dimensional slice images can be constructed from a series of adjacent lateral scans. In Doppler OCT mode, the velocity data can be acquired using Kasai autocorrelation function for the adjacent scans(Kasai). 


\section{Materials and Methods}
\subsection{Materials}
Warm tap water was cooled down to room temperature overnight for reducing the gas content of the water. The xanthan gum solution was prepared in the water by adding an amount equalling concentration of 0.01\% \todo{(w/w)?}. The used xanthan gum (XG) type was Ticaxan (TIC Gums, White Marsh, MD). The average molecular weight of XG was approximately 6 million Daltons. For the optical velocity measurements, a small amount of coffee creamer (1-2\% by volume, Nestl\'{e} Coffee-mate, Nestl\'{e}, Switzerlnd) was added as a light scattering tracer to both of these fluids. Notice that the coffee creamer is not an appropriate tracer for ultrasound and thus the UDV measurements with water and xanthan solution were omitted. 

Fully bleached softwood kraft pulp (BSK) samples were provided by a Finnish pulp mill \todo{is there a name?} as dried sheets. The length-weighted mean fibre length was XXX mm. The pulp was disintegrated in deionised water, firstly by soaking for several hours and then under high intensity mixing with an overhead stirrer (Glas-Col Precision Stirrer, Glas-Col, LLC). The tests were performed with a fibre mass concentration of 0.42\% (w/w).

Microfibrillated cellulose was obtained from Daicel Chemical Industries (Japan). The product type was Celish\textsuperscript{\textregistered} KY-100G, which is manufactured from purified wood pulp. The properties of the MFC have been reported in the literature \cite{haavisto2011}. The average length and diameter of the fibres are 350 and 15 $\mu$m, respectively \cite{Tatsumi}. Although the fibre diameters are quite large, the size distribution of the fibrils ranges from microscale to nanoscale. Prior to the measurements, the cellulose samples were diluted with deionised water under high intensity mixing with an overhead stirrer (Glas-Col). The mass concentration measured with a Halogen Mettler Toledo Moisture Analyzer (model HR83, Mettler-Toledo International, Inc., Columbus, OH) was 0.40\% (w/w).

\subsection{Pipe flow system}
The measurement unit consisted of a 2.5 m long optical grade glass pipe with an inner diameter of 19 mm. The flow in the pipe was driven using a low-pulsation progressive cavity pump (Seepex MD series). Total volume of the sample in the flow loop and in the tank was 13.5 litres. The fluid temperature in the loop was set to 21 $^{\circ}$C with a digital temperature controller (PolyScience, model 9610).
The volumetric flow rate in the loop was adjusted manually using the pump control voltage. The flow rate was measured with a magnetic flow meter (Siemens, Sitrans F M MAGFLO) and used as a reference for the comparison studies. The fluid temperature during each trial point was measured manually with a type K thermocouple (connected to a multimeter, Fluke Corporation, Everett, WA). If needed, the temperature controller was adjusted accordingly. The wall shear stress at each flow rate was found based on pressure difference measurement between two 1.5 mm diameter taps drilled through the pipe wall located at 74 and 126 diameters downstream from the pipe inlet. The pressure difference measurement was done using calibrated sensors (Rosemount, sensor types 3051 and 2051, Emerson Electric Company, St. Louis, MO).

\subsection{Velocity Profiling Equipment and Setup}

A DOP2000 (Signal-Processing S.A., Switzerland) instrument was used for the ultrasound Doppler velocity profiling (UDV) measurements. An ultrasound probe with 4 MHz frequency and 5 mm active piezo element was installed in a water bath surrounding the pipe. The angle between the probe axis and the pipe wall was 78.5$^{\circ}$. To avoid measuring velocity profiles in the region where the emitted ultrasound waves are irregular, the distance between probe and the pipe surface was set larger than the near field distance (ca. 17 mm). The length of a single ultrasound pulse was set to 2 cycles. corresponding to a pulse length of approximately 0.375 mm in water. The ultrasound pulse repetition frequency was varied between 500 Hz and 2000 Hz in order to exploit the full velocity resolution range, which is done with 8-bit dynamics in the used instrument. The calculated spatial resolution of the UDV profiles was 0.XX mm meaning that single velocity values are measured with this interval. In all the measurements, 32 consecutive pulse emissions were used to calculate a single velocity value in each sampled depth locations. 

A series of 500 individual UDV velocity profiles was recorded for each flow rate, and the final mean velocity profile was calculated as an average of these. The determination of the spatial locations of the velocity profile were corrected according to \cite{Wang}. In the correction method, the Doppler angle and measuring location are determined taking into account the ultrasound refraction and the ultrasound velocity difference in different media, i.e. in the water bath, inside the pipe wall and in the flowing medium. The speed of sound was assumed to be 1500 m/s and 3962 m/s in water and glass, respectively.

For magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements, velocity profiles were acquired by using a velocity encoded Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) sequence \cite{arola1999,arola1997,choi2002,choi2003}. The PGSE sequence uses phase-encoded and frequency-encoded magnetic field gradients to obtain velocity and radial position, respectively. For these measurements, an Aspect Imaging 1 T MRI spectrometer with a peak gradient strength of 0.3 T/m was used (Aspect Imaging,Hevel Modi?in Industrial Area, Shoham, Israel). The radio frequency coil enclosing the pipe was a solenoid with 4 turns, 60 mm in diameter and 60 mm long. For all images, a slice thickness of 30 mm and a field of view (FOV) of 30 mm were used. With MRI, velocity profiles were acquired by using a velocity encoded Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) sequence \cite{li1992,arola1999,arola1997,choi2002,choi2003}. The PGSE sequence uses phase-encoded and frequency-encoded magnetic field gradients to obtain velocity and radial position, respectively. For these measurements, an Aspect Imaging 1 T MRI spectrometer with a peak gradient strength of 0.3 T/m was used. The radio frequency coil enclosing the pipe was a solenoid with 4 turns, 60 mm in diameter and 60 mm long. For all images, a slice thickness of 30 mm and a field of view (FOV) of 30 mm were used. 128 phase encoding steps (to characterize velocity) and 128 frequency encoding steps (to characterize radial position) were used. Imaging paramaters (echo time TE, repetition time TR, velocity sweep width VSW, number of averages) were varied so as to obtain high contrast and signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting matrix was transformed with a 2D Fourier transform into a matrix of signal intensities. Velocity was given by the maximum signal intensity in each row of the matrix. All data analysis was done using MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA).

The OCT device used in this study was Telesto Spectral Domain OCT (Thorlabs, Inc.) with a central wavelength of 1325 nm and bandwidth in excess of 150 nm. The resolution in the axial (beam) direction in water is better than 5 $\mu$m. The device was connected to a master PC for control and data acquisition with system software version 3.2 by Thorlabs. The OCT was utilized for measuring the velocity profile in the Doppler OCT mode. The device was set to acquire sequential axial scans in a single physical position with a Doppler angle of 4-5$^{\circ}$ The Doppler angle was determined from B-scan images composed of 4096 A-scans in a spatial range of 5.00 mm \todo{maybe add some details on what an A or B scan is? -Maria}.

Depending on the flow rate, the frequency of the OCT A-scans was either 5.5, 28 or 91 kHz. Higher A-scan frequencies increase the maximum detectable velocity but decrease the system sensitivity. A flat surface was machined on the pipe outer surface to minimize the glass thickness and to prevent undesired refraction on the outer surface. The post-processing and analysis of the phase-shift (velocity) data was performed in MATLAB. A series of 15x4096 A-scans were analyzed for each flow rate and used to calculate the mean velocity profile.  

The velocity measurements had to be performed in different locations of the pipe due to the physical size and positioning of the equipment. However, independent measurements of the pressure drop and flow rate allow normalisation and thus better comparison of the different velocity profiling techniques. The MRI measurement location was 44 pipe diameters from the flow inlet. The UDV and OCT measurements were performed 105 and 116 diameters from the inlet, respectively. Both UDV and OCT probe were installed horizontally to minimize distortions caused by e.g. sedimentation or air bubbles. The instruments did not interfere with one another in this setup. The experimental flow loop with the measurement locations are shown in Figure \ref{fig:flowsystem}. A summary of the performed experiments is presented in Table \ref{table:exp_summary}.



\section{Results}
The measured axial mean velocity profile data obtained with OCT, UVP and MRI techniques are presented, compared and discussed for the different studied materials, concentrations and flow rates. Prior to the velocity data, results from the pressure drop measurements are presented and discussed.

\subsection{Pressure Drop and Flow Rate}
Pressure drop as a function of flow rate can be used to indicate the type of flow was achieved for different materials in pipe flow.  With water the flow rate range achieved with the pump was 8--160 ml/s equalling Reynolds numbers of approximately 600--11000 (see Figures \ref{fig:dp_vs_Q} and \ref{fig:q_dP_error}). Excluding the transition range, the measured pressure drop generally deviates less than 3\% from the theoretical value. In the laminar region the theoretical pressure drop was calculated using XXX and in the turbulent region the pressure drop was obtained from XXX. 
The relative standard deviations of the pressure drop (std(dP/m)/(dP/m)) and volume flow rate (std(Q)/Q) are shown in Figure \ref{fig:q_dP_error}. According to the results, the flow conditions in the test section appear steady. As expected, the deviation of the pressure drop increases significantly in transition to turbulence and levels off again once the turbulent flow region (Re>4000) is reached.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{q_vs_dP_water_xanthan}
  \caption{Pressure drop as a function of flow rate for water and xanthan solution. Theoretical pressure drop for water is shown with solid line}
  \label{fig:dp_vs_Q}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{q_dP_error}
  \caption{Pressure drop as a function of Reynolds number for water. Theoretical pressure drop for water is shown with dashed lines}
  \label{fig:q_dP_error}
\end{figure}

In the presence of xanthan gum, drag reduction in the turbulent flow region is expected.
The percentage drag reduction is calculated using the measured pressure drop values as 
\begin{equation}
\%DR=100x(dP_{water}-dP_{XG})/dP_{water}
\end{equation}.
The maximum \%DR of 35.5 was obtained with water Reynolds numbers of 3900--4200 after approximately 120 minutes from the trial start. The \%DR value is in good agreement with the corresponding ones found in the literature \cite{Abdulbari}. With higher Reynolds numbers and in course of time noticeable decrease in \%DR is observed due to polymer degradation.

Several studies have been conducted on the pressure drop in the pipe flow of pulp suspensions (References). For unidirectional, axisymmetric flow in circular pipe, the total shear stress at the pipe wall is tau=r/2*dP/L. According to equation provided by Raiskinmäki and Kataja the disruptive shear stress for 0.45\% pine suspension is 4.1 Pa \cite{Raiskinmaki}. Since the shear stress at the wall with the highest shear rate is only 1.11 Pa, it is expected that the flow remains in the plug flow regime. For MFC the disruptive shear stress values for 0.3\% and 0.5\% MFC suspensions have been reported to be approximately 0.8 Pa and 2 Pa, respectively. In these measurements, the highest wall shear stress range of 0.57--2.49 Pa is thus expected to cover the disruptive flow regime of 0.40\% MFC suspension. 



A series of flow rates was applied in the measurement unit and a sequence of axial scans was again recorded in the same physical position. The Doppler angle of the measurement was 86$^{\circ}$. The data was utilised to determine the streamwise mean velocity profile by applying unwrapping algorithm for the gaussian velocity distributions. The presented experimental setup allowed velocities to be determined across XXX to XXX m/s in the vicinity of the pipe wall. The velocity profiles could be built up over a distance range of XXX microns to approximately XXX microns. The profile span was limited by the mass concentration and the flow velocity.

\section{Supplementary information for wheat straw rheology experiments} \label{app:wheat_straw}

\subsection{Additional data analysis}
Conversion versus viscosity data of temperature trials and pre-hydration trials on wheat straw (see Chapter \ref{ch:wheat-rheology}) were fitted against a logarithmic curve,
\begin{equation}
y=a\cdot \log{\eta}+b,
\end{equation} 
where $y$ is the glucan conversion (\% of theoretical), $\eta$ is the apparent viscosity at 10 s$^{-1}$, and $a$ and $b$ are fitting constants. These fits were used to compare overall empirical trends and are not meant as models of this process. The results of these fits are shown graphically in Figures \ref{fig:ws_temp_hem} and \ref{fig:ws_temp_hype} for trials in which the reaction temperature was varied.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5.5in]{appendix/hem_fits}
  \caption[Effects of temperature on liquefaction and saccharification of WS184.]{Conversion versus viscosity of WS184 hydrolyzed at different temperatures on a semi-log scale to highlight potential mass transfer differences between trials. Colored lines are for logarithmic fits.}
  \label{fig:ws_temp_hem}
\end{figure}

On WS184, trials at similar temperatures show similar slopes (compare red and green lines, and orange and blue lines), which may indicate an inherent relationship between the rates of change of conversion and mass transfer that is independent of enzymatic treatment. The difference between trials is more apparent when looking at intercepts ($b$), where TT trials had higher intercepts, as they achieved higher levels of conversion overall. Although empirical in nature, these fits may hint at the synergy between liquefaction and saccharification, given as the slopes of these curves.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5.5in]{appendix/hype_fits}
  \caption[Effects of temperature on liquefaction and saccharification of WS195.]{Conversion versus viscosity of WS195 hydrolyzed at different temperatures on a semi-log scale to highlight potential mass transfer differences between trials. Colored lines are for logarithmic fits.}
  \label{fig:ws_temp_hype}
\end{figure}

A more complex relationship arises when looking at WS195 (Figure \ref{fig:ws_temp_hype}). Slopes were similar for all trials except the trial with Celluclast at 45 \degree C (``WS195-CN, 45 C''), and the difference between trials with similar slopes arises in the intercept ($b$), which is highest for trials that reached higher levels of conversion. Again, the similarity in slopes might indicate an inherent, synergistic relationship within this process. The synergy between saccharification and liquefaction arises from the fact that liquefaction leads to higher levels of conversion, and in WS195 trials, in which liquefaction happened the fastest of all, it may be possible that the rate of liquefaction of TT 45 C, TT 55 C, and CN 55 C is fast enough so as to enable saccharification as quickly as possible. CN 45 C (red line) is significantly different from the rest, and likely because conditions were not optimal for liquefaction and saccharification of wheat straw.

Lastly, for pre-hydration experiments on wheat straw, the results of these fits are shown graphically in Figure \ref{fig:ws_swell_fit}.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5.5in]{appendix/conv_xfer_swell_fit}
  \caption[Effect of pre-hydration on liquefaction and saccharification of WS184.]{Conversion versus viscosity of WS184-CN (45 C) of both trials on a semi-log scale to highlight potential mass transfer differences due to fiber hydration.}
  \label{fig:ws_swell_fit}
\end{figure}

Curves appear similar, with pre-hydrated fibers showing a slightly steeper slope ($a = 21.9$ versus 19.6), indicating that with a given extent of liquefaction, there was a greater improvement in conversion in pre-hydrated fibers than in unsoaked fibers.

These fits are primarily empirical, but they hint at the synergy at play between liquefaction and saccharification. The slopes, i.e., how much liquefaction appears to improve conversion, seem independent of enzymatic treatment, and only dependent on reaction conditions (i.e., temperature, fiber hydration). The intercept (constant term $b$) of these fits seems more reliant on enzymatic treatment, as the better performing enzymes (TT at 55 \degree C) do have higher yields (and higher intercepts) overall.

\section{Supplementary information for fed-batch enzymatic liquefaction of cellulosic biomass experiments} \label{app:fed-batch}
%\subsection{Calculating Reynolds numbers}
%\subsection{Calculating energy dissipation}
\subsection{Calculation of rates of liquefaction}
To calculate rates of liquefaction in each batch (Figure \ref{fig:liqrates-headloss}A), only the points that correspond to decays in liquefaction (i.e., from a peak in yield stress to a steady state value) were used to account for experimental limitations. Biomass additions were not instantaneous and there was an inherent ``lag'' in yield stress while the flow loop reached homogeneity upon each addition. Times were normalized so that time 0 corresponded to the peak in yield stress. For example, Figure \ref{fig:app_liqrates} shows yield stress as a function of time for batch 4 in ENZ$_{\text{B}}$. The points used for fitting for rates of liquefaction are shown in black, and the points not used are shown in white. A sample fit is shown as a red curve.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5.5in]{appendix/supp_sample_fit}
  \caption[Example of data used to fit rates of liquefaction (batch 4 in ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ at 15.4\% (w/w) solids).]{Example of data used to fit rates of liquefaction (batch 4 in ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ at 15.4\% (w/w) solids). Points in black were included in fitting and points in white were not included. The red curve indicates a sample fit. Normalized time is plotted on a secondary horizontal axis (top), where normalized time $=$ hydrolysis time $–$ time of peak yield stress for that batch (in this case, 2.43 h).}
  \label{fig:app_liqrates}
\end{figure}

Biomass additions were not instantaneous; each batch addition took approximately 10 minutes to thoroughly mix in the flow loop system, which resulted in an increase in yield stress during the last few minutes of each batch. The time of each batch addition as shown in Tables \ref{table:enzB} and \ref{table:enz0} was either the time of enzyme addition for that batch (in the case of ENZ$_{\text{B}}$) or the time when the biomass addition was completed (in the case of ENZ$_{\text{0}}$). The time of peak yield stress was used as ``time 0'' for that batch (in the case shown in Figure \ref{fig:app_liqrates}, time 0 is 2.43 h), and hydrolysis times for that batch were normalized with respect to that time 0. Normalized times are shown in Figure A.1 on the secondary horizontal axis (top). Once times were normalized for each batch, fits of liquefaction were obtained from fitting Equation \ref{app:eqn:liqrate_fedbatch} to the yield stress and time data for each batch,

\begin{equation}
\label{app:eqn:liqrate_fedbatch}
\tau_{0} = a*e^{-b*t}
\end{equation}

where $\tau_{0}$ is the yield stress (Pa), $t$ is time (h), $a$ and $b$ are fitting constants, and an initial rate of liquefaction is given by the derivative of Equation \ref{app:eqn:liqrate_fedbatch} evaluated at $t =$ 0 hours. These results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:liqrates-headloss}A.

\subsection{Peak yield stress values in ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ vs. ENZ$_{\text{0}}$}
The peak (i.e., $t = 0$) slurry yield stress after each batch addition differs for both modes of enzyme addition (see Figure \ref{fig:app_peaktau}), especially after batch additions 5 and 6.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4in]{appendix/peak-tau-supp}
  \caption[Peak slurry yield stress for each batch in both modes of enzyme addition.]{Peak slurry yield stress for each batch in both modes of enzyme addition. ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ is shown in black, and ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ is shown in white. Variations begin to emerge during and after batch 5, when enzyme loadings are similar}
  \label{fig:app_peaktau}
\end{figure}

What is apparent is that although peak slurry yield stresses appear to continuously increase in ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ with respect to ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:tau_conv}A), they only do so for the last two batches. At that point in the process, enzyme-to-substrate ratios begin to be very similar for both ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ (5.76 FPU/g-biomass) and ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ (5 FPU/g-biomass). ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ had all enzymes added at the beginning, meaning that no new enzymes were added after each batch addition. It is possible that there was a delay in liquefaction as the cellulases found the newly added substrate, which resulted in higher yield stress during this homogenization period. In other words, the observed gaps in Figure \ref{fig:app_peaktau} (between peak yield stress for ENZ$_{\text{B}}$ and for ENZ$_{\text{0}}$) may be due to enzymes in ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ initially associated with the biomass in the reactor needing some time to diffuse to the newly added substrate. This period may become longer and longer at later points in hydrolysis (e.g., batches 5 and 6) as cellulases lose some activity due to end product inhibition or the shear stress they may experience in this flow loop setup. In ENZ$_{\text{B}}$, each biomass addition is accompanied by additional cellulases, which would be unassociated with any part of the substrate and thus would see all substrate equally and require less homogenization time than ENZ$_{\text{0}}$. Despite this lag in homogenization, ENZ$_{\text{0}}$ batches liquefied more efficiently over the entire course of hydrolysis (12 hours), indicating that it is overall a more efficient mode of enzyme addition.

%\subsection{Liquefaction of Solka-Floc 200 EZ}
%Exponential to linear trends.

\section{Supplementary studies on pre-hydration effects} \label{app:swelling}
In work done on wheat straw (Chapter \ref{ch:wheat-rheology}) and Solka-Floc (Chapter \ref{ch:eg}), blank runs showed that biomass swells in the flow loop when no enzyme is added. As an addendum to that, experiments were done on Solka-Floc to determine if swelling impacts rates liquefaction and hydrolysis of a cellulosic substrate. Batch experiments were done with samples of Solka-Floc 200EZ at 21.9\% (w/w) solids with 5 FPU/g-biomass of Cellic CTec2 (Novozymes). Reactants (unmixed) were preheated in an incubator at 50 \degree C for approximately 1 hour prior to sample preparation. In a 25 ml cylindrical container containing 8.69 ml of 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0), 2.8 g of Solka-Floc 200EZ were added. Prior to enzyme addition, samples were placed in an incubator (DigiTherm, TriTech Research, Los Angeles, CA) set to 50 \degree C and allowed to hydrate for 0, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours. The mechanical strength of pre-hydrated samples was measured with a texture analyzer (Model TA-XT2i, Texture Technologies Corporation, Scarsdale, NY) with a 5 kg load cell and a 3 mm cylindrical stainless steel probe as shown previously by \citet{lavenson2012b}. Mechanical strengths were normalized (``Normalized Mechanical Strength,'' NMS) against that of the sample that was not hydrated. Figure \ref{fig:swell0} shows the NMS of samples prior to enzyme addition.

To start hydrolysis, 197 $\mu$l of CTec2 were added to each container and mixed well by hand, and the sample containers were placed in a sample holder attached to an orbital mixer (Orbit P2, Labnet International, Woodridge, NJ) set to 150 RPM placed in the incubator. Experiments were done in duplicate for each time point in results.

At 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 hours of hydrolysis, samples were removed from the incubator and quenched by placing in a 90 \degree C water bath for 5 minutes. Following quenching, the mechanical strength of samples was measured with a texture analyzer, and normalized against the mechanical strength at the start of hydrolysis. Liquefaction rates were determined from fits of NMS versus time to exponential decays,

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:liqrate}
F_{norm}=a\cdot e^{-b*t}+c
\end{equation}
where $F_{norm}$ is the normalized mechanical strength (dimensionless), $t$ is the assay time (s), and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are fitting constants. The rate of liquefaction was then the derivative of Equation \ref{eqn:liqrate} at time 0, here reported as $a\cdot b$. Figure \ref{fig:swell_liq} shows that different levels of swelling had no effect on liquefaction rates.

Extents of hydrolysis were also measured as explained in Chapter \ref{ch:methods}, calculated from HPLC measurements. Figure \ref{fig:swell_conv} shows extent of hydrolysis for all swelling times. No significant differences in hydrolysis were seen due to fiber pre-hydration.

As shown with experiments on wheat straw in Chapter \ref{ch:wheat-rheology}, pre-hydration does not impact saccharification or liquefaction of a model cellulosic substrate (Solka-Floc) either.


ATLAB scripts for data acquisition, processing, and analysis

MATLAB scripts written to aid in data acquisition and analysis throughout the studies presented in this dissertation are shown below.

\section{ Pressure data acquisition }
A National Instruments data acquisition (DAQ) card (National Instruments, Austin, TX) transmitted the in-line pressure drop data to the PC via USB. The script ``DAQdata.m'' shown here was used to record that data and convert it to pressure units.
\lstinputlisting{appendix/DAQ_data_112014.m}

\section{ Pressure averaging }
Each flow image acquired via MRI was stored and logged with both a timestamp associated with the default file name that corresponds to when the image acquisition started, and a timestamp of when the image acquisition ended. Both of these time stamps were used to determine the average pressure drop of the slurry during each acquisition by taking all data points acquired and logged by ``DAQdata.m'' between those two time points and averaging them. An image acquisition took approximately 1-2 minutes on average, during which pressure could vary, especially during liquefaction.
\lstinputlisting{appendix/pressure_averaging.m}

\section{ HPLC data parsing }
The following script was used to parse High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) output data to obtain only concentrations for each sample.
\lstinputlisting{appendix/read_HPLC_data_v2.m}

\section{ Head loss calculations }
For experiments shown in Chapter \ref{ch:fed-batch}, head loss was calculated for each batch addition (see Figure \ref{fig:liqrates-headloss}B) using the script below.
